#Well, I don't know, but I've been told
#Uranium ore's worth more than gold
#Sold my Cad', I bought me a Jeep
#I've got that bug and I can't sleep
#Uranium fever has done and got me down
#Uranium fever is spreadin' all around
#With a Geiger counter in my hand
#I'm a-goin' out to stake me some government land
#Uranium fever has done and got me down
#Well I had talk with the AEC
#And they brought out some maps that looked good to me
#And one showed me a spot that he said he knowed
#So I straddled my Jeep and headed down the road
#I reckon I drove about 100 miles
#Down a bumpy road out through the wilds
#When all of sudden I bounced to a stop
#At the foot of a mountain, didn't have no top
#Uranium fever has done and got me down
#Uranium fever is spreadin' all around
#With a Geiger counter in my hand
#I'm a-goin' out to stake me some government land
#Uranium fever has done and got me down
#Well I took my Geiger and I started to climb
#Right up to the top where I thought I'd find
#A hunk of rock that would make it click
#Just like I'd read about Vernon Pick
#On the second day, I made the top
#And I'm tellin' you, Steve, I was ready to stop
#The only clickin' that I heard that day
#Was the bones in my back that had gone astray
#Uranium fever has done and got me down
#Uranium fever is spreadin' all around
#With a Geiger counter in my hand
#I'm a-goin' out to stake me some government land
#Uranium fever has done and got me down
#Well, you pack up your things
#You head out again
#Into some unknown spot where nobody's been
#You reach the spot where your fortune lies
#You find it's been staked by 17 other guys
#Well, I ain't kiddin', I ain't gonna quit
#That bug's done caught me and I've been bit
#So with a Geiger counter and a pick in my hand
#I'll keep right on stakin' that government land
#Uranium fever has done and got me down
#Uranium fever is spreadin' all around
#With a Geiger counter in my hand
#I'm a-goin' out to stake me some government land
#Uranium fever has done and got me down
