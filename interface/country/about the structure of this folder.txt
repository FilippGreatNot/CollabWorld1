Focus spriteTypes and shine focus spriteTypes should be in separate from others files the name of whose end with _focus and _focus_shine respectively because it is much easier to generate shine spriteTypes for me
There is no strict rule about where should you place your gfx files, but I recommend placing it like this [folder]/[region (you should see some of them already)]/[country tag]/[file].gfx
