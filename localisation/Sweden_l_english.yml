 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 
 DESC_ARVID:0 "Where does one begin to describe the helmsman of Swedish Politics, Arvid Lindman? To the Conservative Party he is the messiah, bringing the conservatives back from the brink of destruction. And to the social democrats he is the anti-christ, rising from hell to defeat them at the polling station.  There is a rising tide of radicalism sweeping Europe and Sweden, will the helmsman be able to guide the ship of the Swedish state safely into the future, or will he go down with the ship? Only time will tell. "
