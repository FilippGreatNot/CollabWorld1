 ### Focuses ###
 SWE_talk_with_king: "Talk with the King"
 SWE_talk_with_king_desc: "The Swedish King is our head of state and technically the ruler of our country, but Sweden is also a democracy so he doesn't have any real power. Regardless, Lindman visiting the King's residence and having a recorded talk with him which will be published in the Stockholm Times will surely do good things for our party popularity and increase support for the President."
 SWE_lindman_presidency: "The Lindman Presidency"
 SWE_lindman_presidency_desc: "Currently Sweden is lead by the man often called the Messiah of Swedish politics, president Lindman. There is great respect in the country for him and everything is going perfect. Sweden is recovering and growing. However, many people are worried that a new crisis is coming, one which will shape the future of the country for years to come."
 SWE_buy_american_weapons: "Buy American Weapons"
 SWE_buy_american_weapons_desc: "With the fragile state of the world, it is inevitable that the reds in the east or the browns in the West will threaten the independence of Scandinavia eventually. The Rockefeller regime is a big exporter of guns so a good choice for us to make will be to buy some in order to strengthen our infantry."
 SWE_our_brightest_hour: "Our Brightest Hour"
 SWE_our_brightest_hour_desc: "Sweden is the baštine of democracy and prosperity in Europe, a very fragile continent. We shine as a beacon of hope. The economy continues to grow, the country grows more united and we are becoming more influential on the world stage. There is nothing that can stop the Swedish Tiger."
 SWE_snap_elections: "Hold Snap Elections"
 SWE_snap_elections_desc: "The worst scenario possible has happened. The Economic house of cards has collapsed and the economy is in shambles. In the meantime, the Opposition is profiting from our failures. Most dangerously, the communists are gaining popularity. To save face, we should hold snap elections and try to get another Term."
 SWE_another_term_for_lindman: "Another Term for Lindman"
 SWE_another_term_for_lindman_desc: "The expectations of our political enemies were wrong. Lindman's government survived the crisis and now it is time to heal. Another 4 years of conservative rule will help get out of the crisis and become prosperous once again."
 SWE_social_democrat_victory: "Victory of the Social Democrats"
 SWE_social_democrat_victory_desc: "Lindman was a bad man and he lead Sweden to ruin. Now we are back in charge with Hjalmar Branting as our President. Bright times await Sweden, but first we must fix Lindman's mistake and heal the country."
 SWE_peaceful_revolution: "The Peaceful Revolution"
 SWE_peaceful_revolution_desc: "The cards of the capitalist regime have fallen. Now the red banner flies high over Stockholm. Inform Moscow of our succes. This is the easiest revolution in history. We didnt have to shoot  a bullet to liberate the Swedish worker. Now it is time to change Sweden into a socialist state. However, many people in the military are skeptic about us and there are rumours they are planning a coup. We must make sure this doesn't happen."
 
 SWE_new_social_strikes: "New Socialist Strikes"
 SWE_soaring_inflation: "Soaring Inflation"
 SWE_economic_crash: "Economic Crash"
 
 SWE_economic_house_of_cards: "Economic House of Cards"
 SWE_economic_house_of_cards_desc: "Our economy is one never tried in the world before. It is dependant upon many factors like a benefitial global situation, the stock market and social welfare. If one card goes down, everything else goes down with it. Now of course such a new articulate system provides its benefits, but should something go wrong Sweden might not see light again."
 
 SWE_shadow_of_adalen: "Shadow of Adalen"
 SWE_shadow_of_adalen_desc: "5 years ago 20 workers got killed in a strike, resulting in a nationwide socialist tragedy. The legacy of this strike combined with the global situation lead to a large popularity of marxists in the country. Soon, we might see a communist Sweden enter the world stage if the legacy doesnt go away."
 
 SWE_neutral_tiger: "Neutral Tiger"
 SWE_neutral_tiger_desc: "Sweden is one of the most neutral countries in the world, and one of the most protected ones. Anyone who wants to invade us should only try- its just not happening. However, with the changing global landscape, it might be neccesary to make a more serious stance in favor of democracy."
 
 ### Events ###
 swe_sweden.1.t: "New Snap Elections"
 swe_sweden.1.a: "Lindman secures another Term"
 swe_sweden.1.b: "Victory of Socialdemokraterna"
 swe_sweden.1.c: "The Communist Party achieves victory"
 swe_sweden.1.d: "With the economic crash of 1922, it is neccesary for us to hold snap elections. Either we win and continue or dont hold snap elections and our party popularity collapses so much we won't even be able to win ever again. There are 3 main contestants. They include us, the social democrats and the ascendant communist party of Sweden. Who will take charge today?"
 swe_sweden.2.t: "The Last Hour"
 swe_sweden.2.d: "The Economic House of Cards has collapsed. Due to the global climate, swedish spending and a crash on the stock market the whole economy went upside down within hours. The situation is dire and we must hold snap elections or do something to save our face. This is an unfortunate turn of events. We were about to have a new high... and this event has stopped it by years."
 swe_sweden.2.a: "OH HELL NAH"
 swe_sweden.3.t: "Conservatives Retain Power in Sweden"
 swe_sweden.3.d: "The Government of Arvid Lindman continues to govern the Kingdom of Sweden after the Snap Elections caused by the sudden instability in the country and the economic crisis that hit Sweden a few weeks ago. This comes as a surprise and a great show of power for the Swedish Moderate Party who were expected to lose the election by a margin due to the crisis. The victory of the conservatives means the continuation of the policies Sweden has been doing in the last few years. Many are discussing about a new foreign policy though. It remains to be seen what happens in that regard."
 swe_sweden.3.a: "Unexpected"
 swe_sweden.4.t: "Social Democrats win the Swedish Snap Elections"
 swe_sweden.4.d: "The Economic Crisis and sudden instability The Kingdom of Sweden faced in the last few weeks led to the Former President Arvid Lindman calling for snap elections. The Opposition to Lindman's government, the social democrats, suceeded in winning the election and securing power. They will govern the country for the next 4 years. Their administratiom might see improved worker rights or a different foreign policy based on cooperation with Sweden's neighbors. The real consequences of the victory of the Social Democrats remain to be seen."
 swe_sweden.4.a: "Interesting Development"
 swe_sweden.5.t: "Communist Party secures Victory in Sweden"
 swe_sweden.5.d: "The bloodbath of Adalen remains in memory of the Kingdom of Sweden. But today, many would say it has been avenged. The Swedish Snap Elections had a result totally unexpected to global observers: the Communist Party won by a margin and secured control of the country. This is a significant development as this means another country has joined the revolutionary cause in Europe. This will bring both stability and instability as international reactions arrive to this sudden development. Will Sweden get closer to the Soviet Union?"
 swe_sweden.5.a: "Lenin must be smiling"
