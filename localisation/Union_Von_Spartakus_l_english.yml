 UVS_rise_germany_desc:0 "Germany is finally breaking free from its capitalist overlords. Bismarck and Wilhelm both tried to suppres us, and even the social democrats in the west betrayed the Revolution. That is why we rose up in the first place, to defend true revolutionary socialist ideals against the capitalist swine that tried to destroy us. We are sorrounded on all sides by reactionary thugs. This shall go on no longer though! The Revolution starts today, and Germany will arise from the ruins!"
