  ### Events ###
 problem.1.t: "The End of Russian civil war"
 problem.1.d: "The new year, 1922, has already finally put an end to the civil war in Russia. The Red Army gave up and the white rats managed to escape beyond the Don and the Urals. Fortunately, the Ural Republic is our main pain in the ass in the revolution, it was also not happy with the guests and soon the power fell into the hands of the local administrators. \n \n It is undoubtedly glad that such a tidbit did not go to the insane admiral. No matter how he tries, the coward and traitor Kolchak, who has settled on the other side of the Urals, will not be able to turn it from a lifeless desert into something, while we have control over the industrial center of Russia! \n \n Of course, there is still a threat in the south in the form of General Denikin. He managed to gain a foothold on the right bank of the Don, where he will be able to hide from us for some more time, while we support our forces in Kyrgyzstan under the command of Alexander Ilyich Yegorov, whose 9th Army is fighting to the death with the Alash Autonomy. \n \n Not only that, something happened that no one expected. Mikhail Tukhachevsky unexpectedly went aganist high command of the Red Army and started tp march to Berlin, despite the signed peace. And even though Germany collapsed before he could do it, he refused to return under our command. It's completely incomprehensible what Red Napoleon has in mind, but he must have had a good enough reason to betray us.\n \n In any case, only time will tell where this will lead."
 problem.1.a: "This is only the begining"
 problem.2.t: "Look at the bright side"
 problem.2.d: "Nicholas II, so hated by the people still with us, under protection, we could not so easily lose such a large lever of pressure in the form of the royal family. White supporters are desperate to kidnap him, but to no avail. The Cheka under the control of the Iron Phoenix copes with its work as competently as possible. \n \n With such leaders and such power, the red banner of the Soviet Union will fly over all of Russia! And the great writer Maxim Gorky immortalized this in his poems! He, the hero who inspired our soldiers on all fronts and made an imperceptible contribution to the victory over the Entente and Germany! \n \n The dim-witted imperialists hoped for a simple walk, but there is no one to break the army of ordinary workers and peasants, because even the most powerful military machine of imperialism will not be able to extinguish the fire in the hearts of people who are fighting for freedom! It is thanks to the forces of the people that the world's first Socialist State appeared on the maps. Lenin's hand led us here. And nothing else confirms the correctness of our words, as people, previously subordinate to the tyranny of the Whites, came over to our side. Boris Savinkov and even Brusilov himself are now with us."
 problem.2.a: "There is much work to be done."
 problem.3.t: "XI Congress of the RKP"
 problem.3.d: "And so gentlemen, after the end of the civil war, it is time to take a sober look at the situation and tackle the problem. Only now, before their decision, we need to settle a few more cases that we could not deal with during the Civil War, so that nothing would interfere with us along the way. \n \n Well, it’s time to do these very things at the extraordinary congress of the RKP! Onward and with the song."
 problem.3.a: "Let's see what we have here"
 problem.4.t: "The politics of our relationship to religion"
 problem.4.d: "The revolution was over, and life began to gradually return to normal. \n Among other things, the imperial clerics began to get out of their holes, followed by erring citizens who believe that God will help them. Should I "помочь" им или встать на их сторону? \n\n Быть может мы заблуждались на их счёт?"
 problem.4.a: "Perhaps we should make a compromise."
 problem.4.b: "We have nothing to talk about with fanatics."
 problem.5.t: "The question of democracy"
 problem.5.d: "In 1917, during the revolution, no one cared about rights and freedoms, everyone was focused on seizing power. Therefore, then the so-called "
 problem.5.a: "Give free rein to everyone, but continue to control the situation."

 problem.5.c: "The working people will never doubt the truth of Marx's teachings!"
 problem.6.t: "The issue of the Soviet direction of science"
 problem.6.d: "The time for the flourishing of the proletariat has come! And what is a proletarian without a factory? And what is a factory without a proletarian? They will be hosting guests soon! \n However, it is still not decided whether they will be waiting for incomprehensible cars or something simpler that the former peasants can quickly master."
 problem.6.a: "Better not to rush, otherwise we risk being crushed by a steam locomotive!"
 problem.6.b: "The proletarian cannot be frightened by any difficulties."
 problem.7.t: "Country's current development plan"
 problem.7.a: "Comrade Stalin's projects look promising. Industrialization is worth it."
 problem.7.b: "We are not yet ready for such large projects. The Cheka can control collectivization."
 problem.8.t: "The Revolution"
 problem.8.a: "We cannot afford to make such plans at the current level. Comrade Trotsky must slow down his ardor."
