 YUG_a_broken_kingdom: "A Broken Kingdom"
 YUG_a_broken_kingdom_desc: "With it's independence and territories secured, many citizens of our nation thought that they could finally leave the political crises, violence and bloodshed behind them for a stable future.

Yet, the lingering effects of the insurrection continue to scar our nation and people."

Meanwhile, the Communists gained popularity in the south, using bitter workers and farmers as their main voting bloc. The nation almost fell apart, with the only saving grace being the royal intervention. Even with this so-called 'political ceasefire', the harsh political tension is still felt in the Kingdom."

 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_I_YUG_DESC: "Alexander I, born on December 16. 1888., into the Karađorđević dynasty, today bears the title "The Unifier." Many, however, consider him undeserving of this title due to his many flaws. After taking the throne following his father's death, he has enforced both praised and controversial policies that have continually hurt the popularity of the dynasty.
