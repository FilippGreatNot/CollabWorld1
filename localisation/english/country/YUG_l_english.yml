 ### Focuses ###
 YUG_a_broken_kingdom: "A Broken Kingdom"
 YUG_a_broken_kingdom_desc: "With it's independence and territories secured, many citizens of our nation thought that they could finally leave the political crises, violence and bloodshed behind them for a stable future. Yet, even after 4 years since the end of the Great War and the formation of the Kingdom, the people remain divided. A nation truly broken."
 YUG_the_legacy_of_the_uprising: "The Legacy of the Uprising"
 YUG_the_legacy_of_the_uprising_desc: "Filipovic's Red Uprising was an attempt at the creation of a communist, worker's state, the first of it's kind in the Balkans. Luckily, Brigadier General Petar Kosic managed to swiftly destroy the uprising. Yet, the lingering effects of the insurrection continue to scar our nation and people." 
 YUG_electoral_gridlock: "Electoral Gridlock"
 YUG_electoral_gridlock_desc: "During the tense 1920 parliamentary elections, the impossible happened: a gridlock. The Croatian Peasant Party achieved the same number of votes as their opponent, the Democratic Party. Meanwhile, the Communists gained popularity in the south, using bitter workers and farmers as their main voting bloc. The nation almost fell apart, with the only saving grace being the royal intervention. Even with this so-called 'political ceasefire', the harsh political tension is still felt in the Kingdom."

With high hopes, the citizens of the new kingdom looked forward to what they believed would be a brighter future. However, political crises, violence, and poverty soon plagued this young nation. The Red Uprising, the Illiteracy Crisis, and many other events signaled to the government that it was time to act. If not, well..."
