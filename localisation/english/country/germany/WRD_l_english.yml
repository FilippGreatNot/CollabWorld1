 ### Events ###
 wrd_dusseldorf.1.t: "Lurking in the Shadows"
 wrd_dusseldorf.1.d: "It has been brought to Mackensen's attention by the military secret police that the Royal Schutzstaffel might be planning a brutal coup to take charge over the whole state tommorow. The KSS was always thought to be a loyal special force, so this came as a surprise to Mackensen who had always trusted this upstart secret police which started as a militia. Now he is left with two choices. He can let them be and risk a coup, or eliminate them completely from the Wehrkommando and kill Himmler."
 wrd_dusseldorf.1.a: "Arrest Himmler, RIGHT NOW!"
 wrd_dusseldorf.1.b: "Surely this can't be true???"
 wrd_dusseldorf.2.t: "Mackensen asks for a POW Exchange"
 wrd_dusseldorf.2.d: "After Germany collapsed, the Army established control West of the Rhine and established a warlord state in Dusseldorf. Due to unfortunate circumstances, this little state still controls a lot of our soldiers in their prisons. Meanwhile, we do the same as we hold many German prisoners. Mackensen has offered a lucrative deal where we get ours back, and they get theirs. This strenghtens our manpower pool, but will also make it more likely the monarchists will take control of Germany which might be to our disadvantage depending on our strategy."
 wrd_dusseldorf.2.a: "Alright, we can exchange"
 wrd_dusseldorf.2.b: "They got captured fair and square!"
 wrd_dusseldorf.3.a: "Great"
 wrd_dusseldorf.3.t: "Exchange Offer Accepted"
 wrd_dusseldorf.3.d: "We have succesfully convinced the government in Paris to do a POW exchange with out state. This will be of great benefit to our efforts to reunify the Vaterland. "
 wrd_dusseldorf.4.t: "France Rejects"
 wrd_dusseldorf.4.d: "The Government in Paris has rejected our offer for a POW exchange. They are most likely sick in their minds. Stupid frog eaters. Go and breathe your shitty sewer air, Coty. We will get them back by force in a few years. Wait and see."
 wrd_dusseldorf.4.a: "A Country based on shit."
 wrd_dusseldorf.5.t: "Mackensen Prepares for Retirement"
 wrd_dusseldorf.5.d: "Mackensen has already emptied his office and made requests for most of his stuff to be transported to his far off villa on the countryside. He doesn't know how he will function without his duties as an officer and a leader and he is not even sure how Germany itself will heal from the war without him. Does he really trust Hindenburg? Perhaps. Ludendorff? Questionable. But he still has to make the choice between the two."
 wrd_dusseldorf.5.a: "Goodbye, Mackensen"
 ### Focuses ###
 WRD_first_catastrophe_of_the_weltkrieg: "The Catastrophe of the Weltkrieg"
 WRD_first_catastrophe_of_the_weltkrieg_desc: "The Great War has been lost and our government has nearly collapsed. We were able to retain a bit of control in the west with our armed forces, who are collapsing too. Everything is going badly and if we don't change course, our complete rule will collapse and the monarchist dream will be destroyed. Maybe hope remains for the fatherland to finally be restored to its former royal glory..."
 WRD_first_reorganise_government_institutions: "Reorganise Government Institutions"
 WRD_first_reorganise_government_institutions_desc: "Due to the war, our institutions have become frail and corrupt. They can't continue functioning like this lest we take a bullet in the fight to reunite the homeland. It is our duty to bring security to the Vaterland by reforming the bureaucracy of the nation."
 WRD_first_provisional_martial_law: "Provisional Martial Law"
 WRD_first_provisional_martial_law_desc: "We have noticed that there is simply too much unorder in our society to tolerate. We must get rid of all the scum that tries to harm the German Vaterland and the only way we can properly do that is by immedieately establishing provisional martial law. We should probably get rid of it later on in order to keep the nation stable but if we want to, there would technically be nothing stopping us from keeping it..."
 WRD_first_restore_public_trust_desc: "The losses of our state have been way too many. We lost a war and we even lost the control of the country. The only thing that remains is our little rump warlord establishment west of the Rhine. It is understandable that the public doesn't trust our governance anymore. We have to change this by restoring public trust first in order to keep the society secure and free of socialist or any revolutionary ideals. This has a higher priority than repairing our standing in the international community."
 WRD_first_restore_public_trust: "Restore Public Trust"
 WRD_first_introduce_economic_austerity: "Introduce Economic Austerity"
 WRD_first_introduce_economic_austerity_desc: "The war has left our economy in utter shambles. We must immedieately introduce EVEN MORE economic austerity in order to keep our entire empire from collapsing. Well... I guess its not an empire anymore but regardless. The reformists in the military administration are criticizing this move as they say that this will provoke even further socialist strife, but I can't really care about the opinion of the traitors of the Vaterland. After all, without their stupid betreyal we wouldn't have lost the war in the first place. Our victory was inevitable!"
 WRD_first_end_the_december_mutiny: "End the December Mutiny"
 WRD_first_end_the_december_mutiny_desc: "Many batallions within the military and even within the Royal Schutzstaffel have started mutinies a bit before christmas in order to completely destabilize and destroy our way of life. This will not persist, we will get rid of all military mutineers and get the KSS mutineers to stop by negotiating with them. This mutiny continuing would probably end our chances of ever reuniting Germany."
 WRD_first_ask_for_an_exchange_of_pows: "Ask for an Exchange of POWs"
 WRD_first_ask_for_an_exchange_of_pows_desc: "We still have many French Prisoners of War, and truly they have just become a trouble for our state as they cost to feed. A smart move would probably be to exchange POWs with the new government in Paris, perhaps they have a brain and will grant us this little deal in these times of strife for both of our countries."
 WRD_first_fight_for_international_recognition: "Fight for International Recognition"
 WRD_first_fight_for_international_recognition_desc: "The opinion of the public does not concern us. They will not trust us anymore no matter what we do. Appeasing them is a lost cause. We should try to cooperate with the international community and get them to fully recognize us as the legitimate rulers of Germany. Many of them might get funny ideas of supporting the evil Spartakusbund or the corrupt Hamburg Republic. We must not allow this to happen."
 WRD_first_beaten_but_not_defeated_desc: "Despite the complete collapse of the Kaiserreich in the Great War, we have still come out victorious- well not victorious- but we survived. Now it is the time to decide on our future after the stabilization and to reunite the German Vaterland under the Kaiser once again... but there are rumours of a coup lurking from one of the usually more loyal elements of the state. Who could it be?"
 WRD_first_beaten_but_not_defeated: "Beaten, but Not Defeated!"
 WRD_first_himmler_assumes_control: "Himmler Assumes Control"
 WRD_first_himmler_assumes_control_desc: "Through a quick coup of the state's institutions, the upstart secret police of the Schutzstaffel took full control of the Wehrkommando. Now Himmler can push through his aryan and esoteric agendas. If he reunites Germany, then Europe will truly be in danger of being united under the thumb of what Himmler describes as the Aryan Man."
 WRD_first_prepare_mackensens_retirement: "Prepare Mackensen's Retirement"
 WRD_first_prepare_mackensens_retirement_desc: "Mackensen has grown old and incompetent, it is the sad truth that he can't manage the royal state through the reunification of Germany. It is also not an option to reinstate the Kaiser, as we view him as incapable of ruling Germany just yet. After all, he is the one who lost us the war. This is why we should appoint either Ludendorff or Hindenburg as our leader until we reunify Germany."
 WRD_first_end_the_regency: "End the Regency"
 WRD_first_end_the_regency_desc: "Despite the warnings of the military government, we will reinstate Kaiser Wilhelm as the head of Germany- or at least what we control of it right now. The reason people are so skeptic of this move is that after all the Kaiser led to Germany's demise in the first place. But it is also clear that the regency can't go on. The Kaiser is the Elect of God, and he will be given back his spot. Alternatively, we could also pick Wilhelm III which would most likely satisfy both sides. It is neccesary to note that Wilhelm III is seen more like a reformist compared to his father and it is likely he would democratize the state if chosen. "
 WRD_abandon_monarchism: "Question German Monarchism"
 WRD_abandon_monarchism_desc: "Wilhelm II and his entire clique were a bunch of losers who couldn't win the war. They watched Germany collapse while they dined in their palaces. This shall go on for no longer. This bastard who led the country to its demise won't be let on the throne again. Himmler will become the new leader of Germany. He is no regent, he is the Führer. The German Century has arrived, and we will flourish in it without the frail Kaiser and his goons."
