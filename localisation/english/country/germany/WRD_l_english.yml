 WRD_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The Old Order of the German Kaiserreich collapsed. The Failure of the German Armies to break the French lines resulted in a total crisis which ended in the collapse of Germany as we know it. The old generals and leaders of the old order are now located in Dusseldorf, planning how to reunite Germany under the rule of the Kaiser. Yet, they also have some members in their ranks who promote more... insane ideas. Someone will inevitably come on top of that power struggle and change Germany forever."

A hierarchy that will allow the German people to thrive as Ubermensch and live in prosperity while the Untermensch Jeudo-Bolsheviks and Political dissidents pay the price and are forced to serve the German cause as they were born to. This will ensure total and absolute obedience to and control over not only the German people and other Untermensch that reside in the vast territories of the Reich through the sheer might of the Schutzstaffel that has brought order. The SS and Reichsführer-SS’s control over all the districts of the Reich will become unprecedented and absolute, becoming the only and most powerful guardians and enforcers of the radicalized Nationalist Socialist regime and its ideological values and purity. Those who oppose us or are politically dissent and unfavoured are to be brutally crushed by the German people who will be converted into Battle-Hardened and unwavering subjects of the Reichsführer and Reich. We shall bring an era of prosperity for the German people. The people will obey, or they will suffer!"

 ### Events ###
 wrd.1.t: "Lurking in the Shadows"
 wrd.1.d: "It has been brought to Mackensen's attention by the military secret police that the Royal Schutzstaffel might be planning a brutal coup to take charge over the whole state tommorow. The KSS was always thought to be a loyal special force, so this came as a surprise to Mackensen who had always trusted this upstart secret police which started as a militia. Now he is left with two choices. He can let them be and risk a coup, or eliminate them completely from the Wehrkommando and kill Himmler."
 wrd.1.a: "Arrest Himmler, RIGHT NOW!"
 wrd.1.b: "Surely this can't be true???"
 wrd.2.t: "Mackensen asks for a POW Exchange"
 wrd.2.d: "After Germany collapsed, the Army established control West of the Rhine and established a warlord state in Dusseldorf. Due to unfortunate circumstances, this little state still controls a lot of our soldiers in their prisons. Meanwhile, we do the same as we hold many German prisoners. Mackensen has offered a lucrative deal where we get ours back, and they get theirs. This strenghtens our manpower pool, but will also make it more likely the monarchists will take control of Germany which might be to our disadvantage depending on our strategy."
 wrd.2.a: "Alright, we can exchange"
 wrd.2.b: "They got captured fair and square!"
 wrd.3.a: "Great"
 wrd.3.t: "Exchange Offer Accepted"
 wrd.3.d: "We have succesfully convinced the government in Paris to do a POW exchange with out state. This will be of great benefit to our efforts to reunify the Vaterland. "
 wrd.4.t: "France Rejects"
 wrd.4.d: "The Government in Paris has rejected our offer for a POW exchange. They are most likely sick in their minds. Stupid frog eaters. Go and breathe your shitty sewer air, Coty. We will get them back by force in a few years. Wait and see."
 wrd.4.a: "A Country based on shit."
 wrd.5.t: "Mackensen Prepares for Retirement"
 wrd.5.d: "Mackensen has already emptied his office and made requests for most of his stuff to be transported to his far off villa on the countryside. He doesn't know how he will function without his duties as an officer and a leader and he is not even sure how Germany itself will heal from the war without him. Does he really trust Hindenburg? Perhaps. Ludendorff? Questionable. But he still has to make the choice between the two."
 wrd.5.a: "Goodbye, Mackensen"
 wrd.6.t: "Demands from Berlin"
 wrd.6.d: "Now that Germany is in the hands of the Old Kaiserreich's Government again, they have requested that we swear loyalty to them and rejoin the Empire as a dominion. This is probably the right choice according to most of the government, but some radicals are arguing we are the real Kaiserreich."
 wrd.6.a: "We preffer Independence"
 wrd.6.b: "We are going home."
 wrd.7.t: "Germany Asks for Qindao"
 wrd.7.d: "The newly reborn German Kaiserreich to give them their old lands of Qindao. This sparked an outrage within our ranks and many also believe that the New Germany doesnt really pose a threat to us. Regardless, it might be more beneficial to give in to avoid the trouble. What should our choice be?"
 wrd.7.a: "We wont give in."
 wrd.7.b: "We have no choice."
 wrd.8.t: "Analyzing Our Mistakes"
 wrd.8.d: "The OHL was the General Staff of the Kaiserreich during the Weltkrieg. It failed miserably in achieving its ambitous goals and led to our downfall. Our current leadership is mostly made of former OHL members. It is logical that we should analyze our mistakes and try to better ourselves for the wars and conflicts that are coming in the future of this glorious nation."
 wrd.8.a: "Our Soldiers were Disloyal."
 wrd.8.b: "Trench Warfare was our biggest mistake."
 wrd.8.c: "We were too disorganized."
 wrd.9.t: "The Wehrkommando Offers Unification"
 wrd.9.d: "The Wehrkommando in Dusseldorf who we have previously had disputes with have offered us to join their ranks and become a part of the New Kaiserreich. This could be a great opportunity for us but many have argued that they don't want to do what we want to do for the country. Ultimately, the current leader must to join whether to join or to reject."
 wrd.9.a: "Reunification awaits"
 wrd.9.b: "We are the True Germany"
 wrd.10.t: "Wilhelm Reads Some Literature"
 wrd.10.d: "Since he is going to become the New Kaiser, Wilhelm decided to renew his knowledge about politics in order to be able to lead the state more accordingly. He is now unsure what to even think of political systems and ideologies, but he definitely knows that someone is to blame for the catastrophe of the weltkrieg and that there must be a scapegoat. His more sane side is telling him to blame the old leadership and the OHL. Maybe the path for the future is some more democracy. But then again, his heart beats to see revenge. He is starting to believe it was the fault of the Judeobolsheviks that Germany lost the Weltkrieg. Will Wilhelm take his pills, or will he let his hate go wild?"
 wrd.10.a: "It was the OHL's fault"
 wrd.10.b: "ALLES DIE SCHULD DER BOLSHEVIKEN"
 wrd.11.t: "The German Empire Demands Northern Schleswig"
 wrd.11.d: "The newly restored German Empire has requested that we hand over Northern Schleswig, a territory previously owned by their government that has many ethnic Germans living in it. This has sparked outrage in our parliament but it is very doubtful that we will be able to withstand a German invasion. What should we do?"
 wrd.11.a: "Reject the Demands"
 wrd.11.b: "There is nothing we can do"
 wrd.12.t: "Germans Offer to Buy Papua New Guinea"
 wrd.12.d: "The German empire has offered us to buy Papua New Guinea, which they previously held. They offer us money and resources that can be helpful to build up our country, should we accept?"
 wrd.12.a: "No, we shouldnt."
 wrd.12.b: "We have a deal!"
 wrd.13.t: "Invitation to the Reichspakt"
 wrd.13.d: "We've been invited to join the newly restored German Kaiserreich in making a European Alliance across Europe to defeat bolshevism and promote stability callled the Reichspakt. Joining in would bring our nation many benefits, should we do it?"
 wrd.13.a: "No, we won't join"
 wrd.13.b: "Join the Reichspakt"
 
 WORLDNEWS.3.t: "SS-Oberabschnitt Unifies Germany"
 WORLDNEWS.3.a: "What an unlikely development"
 WORLDNEWS.3.d: "Information has come from Berlin that the SS-Oberabschnitt led by Heinrich Himmler and his often criticized SS has achieved full control of most of the territories of the Old German Empire and declared the goal of German Reunification as achieved. Himmler has often been criticized for his approach against minorities and his policies by the international community. We shall see what this development brings."

 WRD_first_catastrophe_of_the_weltkrieg: "The Catastrophe of the Weltkrieg"
 WRD_first_catastrophe_of_the_weltkrieg_desc: "The Great War has been lost and our government has nearly collapsed. We were able to retain a bit of control in the west with our armed forces, who are collapsing too. Everything is going badly and if we don't change course, our complete rule will collapse and the monarchist dream will be destroyed. Maybe hope remains for the fatherland to finally be restored to its former royal glory..."
 WRD_first_reorganise_government_institutions: "Reorganise Government Institutions"
 WRD_first_reorganise_government_institutions_desc: "Due to the war, our institutions have become frail and corrupt. They can't continue functioning like this lest we take a bullet in the fight to reunite the homeland. It is our duty to bring security to the Vaterland by reforming the bureaucracy of the nation."
 WRD_first_provisional_martial_law: "Provisional Martial Law"
 WRD_first_provisional_martial_law_desc: "We have noticed that there is simply too much unorder in our society to tolerate. We must get rid of all the scum that tries to harm the German Vaterland and the only way we can properly do that is by immedieately establishing provisional martial law. We should probably get rid of it later on in order to keep the nation stable but if we want to, there would technically be nothing stopping us from keeping it..."
 WRD_first_restore_public_trust_desc: "The losses of our state have been way too many. We lost a war and we even lost the control of the country. The only thing that remains is our little rump warlord establishment west of the Rhine. It is understandable that the public doesn't trust our governance anymore. We have to change this by restoring public trust first in order to keep the society secure and free of socialist or any revolutionary ideals. This has a higher priority than repairing our standing in the international community."
 WRD_first_restore_public_trust: "Restore Public Trust"
 WRD_first_introduce_economic_austerity: "Introduce Economic Austerity"
 WRD_first_introduce_economic_austerity_desc: "The war has left our economy in utter shambles. We must immedieately introduce EVEN MORE economic austerity in order to keep our entire empire from collapsing. Well... I guess its not an empire anymore but regardless. The reformists in the military administration are criticizing this move as they say that this will provoke even further socialist strife, but I can't really care about the opinion of the traitors of the Vaterland. After all, without their stupid betreyal we wouldn't have lost the war in the first place. Our victory was inevitable!"
 WRD_first_end_the_december_mutiny: "End the December Mutiny"
 WRD_first_end_the_december_mutiny_desc: "Many batallions within the military and even within the Royal Schutzstaffel have started mutinies a bit before christmas in order to completely destabilize and destroy our way of life. This will not persist, we will get rid of all military mutineers and get the KSS mutineers to stop by negotiating with them. This mutiny continuing would probably end our chances of ever reuniting Germany."
 WRD_first_ask_for_an_exchange_of_pows: "Ask for an Exchange of POWs"
 WRD_first_ask_for_an_exchange_of_pows_desc: "We still have many French Prisoners of War, and truly they have just become a trouble for our state as they cost to feed. A smart move would probably be to exchange POWs with the new government in Paris, perhaps they have a brain and will grant us this little deal in these times of strife for both of our countries."
 WRD_first_fight_for_international_recognition: "Fight for International Recognition"
 WRD_first_fight_for_international_recognition_desc: "The opinion of the public does not concern us. They will not trust us anymore no matter what we do. Appeasing them is a lost cause. We should try to cooperate with the international community and get them to fully recognize us as the legitimate rulers of Germany. Many of them might get funny ideas of supporting the evil Spartakusbund or the corrupt Hamburg Republic. We must not allow this to happen."
 WRD_first_beaten_but_not_defeated_desc: "Despite the complete collapse of the Kaiserreich in the Great War, we have still come out victorious- well not victorious- but we survived. Now it is the time to decide on our future after the stabilization and to reunite the German Vaterland under the Kaiser once again... but there are rumours of a coup lurking from one of the usually more loyal elements of the state. Who could it be?"
 WRD_first_beaten_but_not_defeated: "Beaten, but Not Defeated!"
 WRD_first_himmler_assumes_control: "Himmler Assumes Control"
 WRD_first_himmler_assumes_control_desc: "Through a quick coup of the state's institutions, the upstart secret police of the Schutzstaffel took full control of the Wehrkommando. Now Himmler can push through his aryan and esoteric agendas. If he reunites Germany, then Europe will truly be in danger of being united under the thumb of what Himmler describes as the Aryan Man."
 WRD_first_prepare_mackensens_retirement: "Prepare Mackensen's Retirement"
 WRD_first_prepare_mackensens_retirement_desc: "Mackensen has grown old and incompetent, it is the sad truth that he can't manage the royal state through the reunification of Germany. It is also not an option to reinstate the Kaiser, as we view him as incapable of ruling Germany just yet. After all, he is the one who lost us the war. This is why we should appoint either Ludendorff or Hindenburg as our leader until we reunify Germany."
 WRD_first_end_the_regency: "End the Regency"
 WRD_first_end_the_regency_desc: "Despite the warnings of the military government, we will reinstate Kaiser Wilhelm as the head of Germany- or at least what we control of it right now. The reason people are so skeptic of this move is that after all the Kaiser led to Germany's demise in the first place. But it is also clear that the regency can't go on. The Kaiser is the Elect of God, and he will be given back his spot. Alternatively, we could also pick Wilhelm III which would most likely satisfy both sides. It is neccesary to note that Wilhelm III is seen more like a reformist compared to his father and it is likely he would democratize the state if chosen. "
 WRD_abandon_monarchism: "Question German Monarchism"
 WRD_abandon_monarchism_desc: "As we begin consolidating our control over the SS Oberabschnitt. It becomes essential to finally question and confront the remaining lingering support for the Hohenzollern and Kaiser, still lingering on for life. The old ways and ideas of the Kaiser are outdated, proven wrong, and a threat to our regime and the ideological purity of the regime. Under the  Reichsführer-SS’s leadership, we will overcome this large wave that our ship is approaching. We must denounce and eradicate the remaining Monarchist sentiment within the country and discredit them for the failure of the Weltkrieg. By finally eliminating our last political dissendents we can now move on to consolidating control and loyalty of the German, Aryan, and all who live life within the Reich.  This will be one of our only bumps in the road to the bright path that awaits the Reich and the Germans. This is the end for the Kaiser."
 WRD_expand_the_schutzstaffel: "Expand the Schutzstaffel"
 WRD_expand_the_schutzstaffel_desc: "Under the Iron grip of the Reichsführer-SS shall we no longer fear of our enemies being a step ahead of us for the Schutzsaffel is here to put our enemies on a tight leash. It has become evident that the Schutzstaffel is the core of our nation and our power. For us to be one step closer to our vigorous Tausendjähriges Reich we must consolidate and ensure total control and absolute loyalty from all that reside within the Reich. We must expand the SS's watching eyes into every corner of society. By increasing their numbers and authority over society and everyday life we are united with an unbreakable chain of loyalty and fear with the most devoted and fanatical Aryans being in the SS. This expansion will put us one step closer to destruction and total annihilation of the Judeo-Bolsheviks and Capitalists as well as Political Dissidents and those who oppose the mighty Reichsführer-SS and the Aryan."

 WRD_the_hindenburg_regency: "The Hindenburg Regency"
 WRD_the_old_kaiser: "The Old Kaiser"
 WRD_the_old_kaiser_desc: "The truth is that no one could ever lead Germany better than its rightful Kaiser, Wilhelm II of Hohenzollern. We must end the regency and had the reigns over him. He is the legitimate ruler of this country, let's not betray our values. We will help him achieve unification, but he has to be at the head. After all, his experience from the Prewar Era and the Weltkrieg are priceless and could make him the most experienced leader in the German wasteland."
 WRD_the_new_kaiser: "The New Kaiser"
 WRD_the_new_kaiser_desc: "The image of Wilhelm II has been forever tainted in the public eye by the loss of the Weltkrieg and with that, our hard-fought German unity. Many people grew disgruntled with the whole idea of a monarchy and some even started to sympathize with dangerous ideologies, such as Bolshevism. To save the perception of monarchism, we need a brand new Kaiser on the throne who will achieve the Wiedervereinigung and forge a more perfect union between German states. Wilhelm III von Hohenzollern, son of Wilhelm II will be the perfect candidate, even though his preferred method of ruling is unclear for now..."
 WRD_securing_state_apparatus: "Secure the State Apparatus"
 WRD_securing_state_apparatus_desc: "To ensure the stability of our realm and regime. We must take careful and decisive steps to control our state apparatus with a firm hand. By purging outdated and rotting, unreliable sectors of our government whilst enforcing loyalty from all those who work within, we shall create an unbreakable chain of loyalty and strength that will allow us to eliminate any Judeo-Bolsheviks Untermensch who dares to stand in our way, ensuring we will live to see the flag of the Thousand Week Reich firmly wave across Germany with all pledging full allegiance to the Reichsführer-SS"

 WRD_an_agricultural_renewal: "An Agricultural Renewal"
 WRD_an_agricultural_renewal_desc: "We must head back Thousands of years ago and rejuvenate an agrarian economy. By promoting agrarianism and rural life, we can ensure the rapid growth of the Aryan male youth ensuring they are ready for tomorrow's war. This will enforce the disciplines of hard work, and labor for the next generation experience. Under the guidance of the Reichsführer-SS Himmler, we will generate the next era filled with prosperity and life for the Aryan Fatherland."
 WRD_increase_working_hours: "Increase Working Hours"
 WRD_increase_working_hours_desc: "To achieve our high-standard goals and ambitious and continued growth in industrial efficiency and productivity which will highly benefit the Aryan nation. we must demand higher productivity and standards the workers of the Fatherland, especially from Untermensch. This will highly bolster our industrial output when war comes and accelerate our arms production rapidly allowing for the Schutzstaffel’s growth. This will lead to sacrifices but is a necessary step for the prosperity of the Aryan race and its dominance of it. Under Himmler dedication, we shall prosper and Germany shall rise once more!"
 WRD_prepare_the_arms_production: "Prepare the Armaments"
 WRD_prepare_the_arms_production_desc: "As the clock ticks it becomes clear that we are closer than ever to reunifying the fatherland under the flag of the Schutzstaffel. Our arsenal is the driving dagger that will be key in all the offensives that may lay in tomorrow’s war. With our state-of-the-art weapons, we may be able to inflict swift and decisive victories on the traitors of the German people. With Himmler watching and directing the army with caution we will be ready for when the clock strikes 12:00 with all of Germany breathing in a bated breath."

 WRD_embrace_germanic_supremacy_desc: "As the clock gets closer than ever the final test awaits that will test all that we have done up to date with our grand masterpiece. All of Germany is ready to raise their hand ready to embrace the fact of German Supremacy. The path that lies ahead may be rough however we are ready with all we have for the storm that lies ahead. We are stepping into unknown waters only time will tell what the final fate of the German people however it is bright and prosperous for with blood and death comes victory.  The Aryans will come out with the graceful hand of the Reichsführer-SS we shall proclaim one final victory over the Judeo-Bolshevik pest starting with the reunification of the Fatherland!"
 WRD_a_purple_germany: "A Purple Germany"
 WRD_a_purple_germany_desc: "As we stand on the final step to our greatest victory to date we must overcome our greatest challenge yet overcome our greatest foes and come out stronger than before. This final victory is shrouded in great uncertainty when we approach an era of conflict and death. Here you win or you die! The shadow of the Reichsführer-SS’s vision of a Aryan Realm has become more real than ever with our destiny being our greatest victory or worst disaster leading to ruin. Our path forward will be filled with mines and holes that may cause our ship to finally come to a halt. However, with the help of our Heroic Reichsführer-SS Himmler we will see the final victory come to reality and the flag of the Tausendjähriges Reich fly in the cold breeze of Berlin. From now on the path that may elevate us to the gates of victory and triumph or plunge into an unrecoverable dead end where the Aryan race will go extinct along with all that we have worked and died for. We must raise our heads forward for the German eagle raises its wings once more. SS Marschiert ins Feindesland und singt ein Teufelslied!."

We should purge these pests from our lands, and without their destructive activities, Germany can achieve world dominance free from degenerate ideologies."

 WRD_every_revolution_has_a_reaction_desc: "Now that we have a Kaiser on the throne again, we should consolidate our power, similarly to Bismarck in our previous empire. A strong state is only possible under a strong leader with absolute powers, so he can guide us to greatness once again without him being hindered by useless and harmful political entities, such as "parliament" and "elections". Der Staat, ich bin es!"

 WRD_promise_revenge_for_the_weltkrieg_desc: "Our perfect union of the German people fell apart thanks to the interfering Entente powers, thus robbing Germany from its imperial glory and important, almost even dominant place in the world stage. Vengeance is our only path towards restoring our respected Empire, and the people should know their enemies and more importantly, hate them with a burning passion. When the time comes, we will burn Paris and London to the ground!"

He is one of our most loyal men, having fought to preserve our legacy in the region. Now that Deutsch-Ostafrika is part of the empire once again, we shall support their army with guns and money so that they can strenghten the German grip on the region."

 WRD_first_reestablish_the_kriegsmarine_desc: "Ten years ago, our navy was the most powerful in the world. We challenged the British rule of the Seas and dominated the oceans.

 WRD_first_retake_east_prussia_desc: "This country was united by the House of Hohenzollern which started in Prussia. Nowadays, these lands are under the control of the tyrant Mikhail Tukhachevsky, who is a bolshevik and servant of the Great Satan in Moscow. We must liberate the German people living there from his regime through force of arms. Any negotiation with the bolshevik scum will inevitably fail, so we have no other choice but to use force."

 WRD_first_offer_the_irish_protection_desc: "The Irish people are one of the most resilient on the face of the planet. They fought bravely for their freedom against the British and are now once again under threat because of the Fullerite regime. We will offer them entry into the Reichspakt and protection so that they may overcome these challenges and grow to become a prosperous country. On top of that, Ireland will be a very strategic spot for us to launch operations against our old enemies."

 WRD_first_reinvite_the_old_allies_desc: "In the Weltkrieg, we fought as a part of the Zentralmächte. All of our allies were loyal and disciplines. Among them were Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary. The reasons we lost were beyond us. However, we must embrace our common legacy and take revenge on those who stole our freedom and killed our children. We will reinvite our old allies to be a part of the new Reichspakt alliance we established earlier."
