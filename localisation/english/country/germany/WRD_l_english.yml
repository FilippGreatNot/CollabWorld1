 WRD_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The Old Order of the German Kaiserreich collapsed. The Failure of the German Armies to break the French lines resulted in a total crisis which ended in the collapse of Germany as we know it. The old generals and leaders of the old order are now located in Dusseldorf, planning how to reunite Germany under the rule of the Kaiser. Yet, they also have some members in their ranks who promote more... insane ideas. Someone will inevitably come on top of that power struggle and change Germany forever."

This will ensure total and absolute obedience to and control over not only the German people and other Untermensch that reside in the vast territories of the Reich through the sheer might of the Schutzstaffel that has brought order. The SS and Reichsführer-SS’s control over all the districts of the Reich will become unprecedented and absolute, becoming the only and most powerful guardians and enforcers of the radicalized Nationalist Socialist regime and its ideological values and purity. Those who oppose us or are politically dissent and unfavoured are to be brutally crushed by the German people who will be converted into Battle-Hardened and unwavering subjects of the Reichsführer and Reich.

 ### Events ###
 wrd.1.t: "Lurking in the Shadows"
 wrd.1.d: "It has been brought to Mackensen's attention by the military secret police that the Royal Schutzstaffel might be planning a brutal coup to take charge over the whole state tommorow. The KSS was always thought to be a loyal special force, so this came as a surprise to Mackensen who had always trusted this upstart secret police which started as a militia. Now he is left with two choices. He can let them be and risk a coup, or eliminate them completely from the Wehrkommando and kill Himmler."
 wrd.1.a: "Arrest Himmler, RIGHT NOW!"
 wrd.1.b: "Surely this can't be true???"
 wrd.2.t: "Mackensen asks for a POW Exchange"
 wrd.2.d: "After Germany collapsed, the Army established control West of the Rhine and established a warlord state in Dusseldorf. Due to unfortunate circumstances, this little state still controls a lot of our soldiers in their prisons. Meanwhile, we do the same as we hold many German prisoners. Mackensen has offered a lucrative deal where we get ours back, and they get theirs. This strenghtens our manpower pool, but will also make it more likely the monarchists will take control of Germany which might be to our disadvantage depending on our strategy."
 wrd.2.a: "Alright, we can exchange"
 wrd.2.b: "They got captured fair and square!"
 wrd.3.a: "Great"
 wrd.3.t: "Exchange Offer Accepted"
 wrd.3.d: "We have succesfully convinced the government in Paris to do a POW exchange with out state. This will be of great benefit to our efforts to reunify the Vaterland. "
 wrd.4.t: "France Rejects"
 wrd.4.d: "The Government in Paris has rejected our offer for a POW exchange. They are most likely sick in their minds. Stupid frog eaters. Go and breathe your shitty sewer air, Coty. We will get them back by force in a few years. Wait and see."
 wrd.4.a: "A Country based on shit."
 wrd.5.t: "Mackensen Prepares for Retirement"
 wrd.5.d: "Mackensen has already emptied his office and made requests for most of his stuff to be transported to his far off villa on the countryside. He doesn't know how he will function without his duties as an officer and a leader and he is not even sure how Germany itself will heal from the war without him. Does he really trust Hindenburg? Perhaps. Ludendorff? Questionable. But he still has to make the choice between the two."
 wrd.5.a: "Goodbye, Mackensen"
 wrd.6.t: "Demands from Berlin"
 wrd.6.d: "Now that Germany is in the hands of the Old Kaiserreich's Government again, they have requested that we swear loyalty to them and rejoin the Empire as a dominion. This is probably the right choice according to most of the government, but some radicals are arguing we are the real Kaiserreich."
 wrd.6.a: "We preffer Independence"
 wrd.6.b: "We are going home."
 wrd.7.t: "Germany Asks for Qindao"
 wrd.7.d: "The newly reborn German Kaiserreich to give them their old lands of Qindao. This sparked an outrage within our ranks and many also believe that the New Germany doesnt really pose a threat to us. Regardless, it might be more beneficial to give in to avoid the trouble. What should our choice be?"
 wrd.7.a: "We wont give in."
 wrd.7.b: "We have no choice."
 wrd.8.t: "Analyzing Our Mistakes"
 wrd.8.d: "The OHL was the General Staff of the Kaiserreich during the Weltkrieg. It failed miserably in achieving its ambitous goals and led to our downfall. Our current leadership is mostly made of former OHL members. It is logical that we should analyze our mistakes and try to better ourselves for the wars and conflicts that are coming in the future of this glorious nation."
 wrd.8.a: "Our Soldiers were Disloyal."
 wrd.8.b: "Trench Warfare was our biggest mistake."
 wrd.8.c: "We were too disorganized."
 wrd.9.t: "The Wehrkommando Offers Unification"
 wrd.9.d: "The Wehrkommando in Dusseldorf who we have previously had disputes with have offered us to join their ranks and become a part of the New Kaiserreich. This could be a great opportunity for us but many have argued that they don't want to do what we want to do for the country. Ultimately, the current leader must to join whether to join or to reject."
 wrd.9.a: "Reunification awaits"
 wrd.9.b: "We are the True Germany"
 wrd.10.t: "Wilhelm Reads Some Literature"
 wrd.10.d: "Since he is going to become the New Kaiser, Wilhelm decided to renew his knowledge about politics in order to be able to lead the state more accordingly. He is now unsure what to even think of political systems and ideologies, but he definitely knows that someone is to blame for the catastrophe of the weltkrieg and that there must be a scapegoat. His more sane side is telling him to blame the old leadership and the OHL. Maybe the path for the future is some more democracy. But then again, his heart beats to see revenge. He is starting to believe it was the fault of the Judeobolsheviks that Germany lost the Weltkrieg. Will Wilhelm take his pills, or will he let his hate go wild?"
 wrd.10.a: "It was the OHL's fault"
 wrd.10.b: "ALLES DIE SCHULD DER BOLSHEVIKEN"
 wrd.11.t: "The German Empire Demands Northern Schleswig"
 wrd.11.d: "The newly restored German Empire has requested that we hand over Northern Schleswig, a territory previously owned by their government that has many ethnic Germans living in it. This has sparked outrage in our parliament but it is very doubtful that we will be able to withstand a German invasion. What should we do?"
 wrd.11.a: "Reject the Demands"
 wrd.11.b: "There is nothing we can do"
 wrd.12.t: "Germans Offer to Buy Papua New Guinea"
 wrd.12.d: "The German empire has offered us to buy Papua New Guinea, which they previously held. They offer us money and resources that can be helpful to build up our country, should we accept?"
 wrd.12.a: "No, we shouldnt."
 wrd.12.b: "We have a deal!"
 wrd.13.t: "Invitation to the Reichspakt"
 wrd.13.d: "We've been invited to join the newly restored German Kaiserreich in making a European Alliance across Europe to defeat bolshevism and promote stability callled the Reichspakt. Joining in would bring our nation many benefits, should we do it?"
 wrd.13.a: "No, we won't join"
 wrd.13.b: "Join the Reichspakt"
 wrd.14.t: "Wilhelm II Reunites Germany"
 wrd.14.d: "The Old Flag of the Kaiserreich has been hanged in front of the Reichstag after the Polish Liberation Army was defeated by the forces of the German army in Silesia. The news that Germany is now once again under its old monarchy have shocked the world. In a speech in front of a million people, Wilhelm II announced the good news and promised to make Germany great once again. International spectators are genuinely scared, as this development could threaten Europe's stability once again as the Kaiser faces the new powers in Europe. Wilhelm II, after all, has been known as a somewhat hawkish and definitely authoritarian person. We will see what is to come."
 wrd.14.a: "How did he come back?"
 wrd.15.t: "Deutsche Ostafrika returns to the fold"
 wrd.15.d: "During the time of civil strife, Ostafrika had broken free from our administration. But now that we not only have reestablished contact with them, they have also agreed to become subordinate to our government as well. The Deustche Ost-Afrika Linie from Hamburg has also been contacted to assist in both the migration of Germans to the colony and the retrieval of personnel there as well. One could say that we have refound our place under the sun."
 wrd.15.a: "Unser Platz an der Sonne."
 wrd.16.t: "A New Religion for the German People?"
 wrd.16.d: "Some in our leadership have decided to try and consider converting the German people to a new religion. Some have proposed ancient germanic paganism as a solution, as it would make us return to our old ways of life and beliefs. Some have opposed this idea heavily and said that the German people must stay loyal to Christianity. A rather minor faction has proposed a very different solution... an Islamic Germany."
 wrd.16.a: "Christianity Must Remain"
 wrd.16.b: "Embrace Paganism"
 wrd.16.c: "Himmler takes his Shahada with Amin Al-Hosseini"
 wrd.17.t: "SS-Generalhauptamt für Reichsaufbau"
 wrd.17.d: "The SS General Main Office for Reich Expansion was established and began operating early this week, with executive orders to start drafting administrative frameworks for the governance, economic integration, and racial restructuring of the future territories we seek to integrate within our Reich."
 wrd.17.a: "Danke Schön, Herr Oberführer."
 
 
 
 
 WORLDNEWS.3.t: "SS-Oberabschnitt Unifies Germany"
 WORLDNEWS.3.a: "What an unlikely development"
 WORLDNEWS.3.d: "Information has come from Berlin that the SS-Oberabschnitt led by Heinrich Himmler and his often criticized SS has achieved full control of most of the territories of the Old German Empire and declared the goal of German Reunification as achieved. Himmler has often been criticized for his approach against minorities and his policies by the international community. We shall see what this development brings."

We must get rid of all the scum that tries to harm the German Vaterland and the only way we can properly do that is by immedieately establishing provisional martial law. We should probably get rid of it later on in order to keep the nation stable but if we want to, there would technically be nothing stopping us from keeping it..."
 WRD_first_restore_public_trust_desc: "The losses of our state have been way too many. We lost a war and we even lost the control of the country. The only thing that remains is our little rump warlord establishment west of the Rhine. It is understandable that the public doesn't trust our governance anymore. We have to change this by restoring public trust first in order to keep the society secure and free of socialist or any revolutionary ideals. This has a higher priority than repairing our standing in the international community."

 WRD_first_introduce_economic_austerity_desc: "The war has left our economy in utter shambles. We must immedieately introduce EVEN MORE economic austerity in order to keep our entire empire from collapsing. Well... I guess its not an empire anymore but regardless. The reformists in the military administration are criticizing this move as they say that this will provoke even further socialist strife, but I can't really care about the opinion of the traitors of the Vaterland. After all, without their stupid betreyal we wouldn't have lost the war in the first place. Our victory was inevitable!"

 WRD_first_end_the_december_mutiny_desc: "Many batallions within the military and even within the Royal Schutzstaffel have started mutinies a bit before christmas in order to completely destabilize and destroy our way of life. This will not persist, we will get rid of all military mutineers and get the KSS mutineers to stop by negotiating with them. This mutiny continuing would probably end our chances of ever reuniting Germany."

 WRD_first_ask_for_an_exchange_of_pows_desc: "We still have many French Prisoners of War, and truly they have just become a trouble for our state as they cost to feed.

 WRD_first_fight_for_international_recognition_desc: "The opinion of the public does not concern us. They will not trust us anymore no matter what we do. Appeasing them is a lost cause. We should try to cooperate with the international community and get them to fully recognize us as the legitimate rulers of Germany. Many of them might get funny ideas of supporting the evil Spartakusbund or the corrupt Hamburg Republic. We must not allow this to happen."

 WRD_first_prepare_mackensens_retirement_desc: "Mackensen has grown old and incompetent, it is the sad truth that he can't manage the royal state through the reunification of Germany. It is also not an option to reinstate the Kaiser, as we view him as incapable of ruling Germany just yet. After all, he is the one who lost us the war. This is why we should appoint either Ludendorff or Hindenburg as our leader until we reunify Germany."
 WRD_first_end_the_regency: "End the Regency"
 WRD_first_end_the_regency_desc: "Despite the warnings of the military government, we will reinstate Kaiser Wilhelm as the head of Germany- or at least what we control of it right now. The reason people are so skeptic of this move is that after all the Kaiser led to Germany's demise in the first place. But it is also clear that the regency can't go on. The Kaiser is the Elect of God, and he will be given back his spot. Alternatively, we could also pick Wilhelm III which would most likely satisfy both sides. It is neccesary to note that Wilhelm III is seen more like a reformist compared to his father and it is likely he would democratize the state if chosen. "

 WRD_abandon_monarchism_desc: "As we begin consolidating our control over the SS Oberabschnitt. It becomes essential to finally question and confront the remaining lingering support for the Hohenzollern and Kaiser, still lingering on for life. The old ways and ideas of the Kaiser are outdated, proven wrong, and a threat to our regime and the ideological purity of the regime. Under the  Reichsführer-SS’s leadership, we will overcome this large wave that our ship is approaching. We must denounce and eradicate the remaining Monarchist sentiment within the country and discredit them for the failure of the Weltkrieg. By finally eliminating our last political dissendents we can now move on to consolidating control and loyalty of the German, Aryan, and all who live life within the Reich.  This will be one of our only bumps in the road to the bright path that awaits the Reich and the Germans. This is the end for the Kaiser."

It has become evident that the Schutzstaffel is the core of our nation and our power. For us to be one step closer to our vigorous Tausendjähriges Reich we must consolidate and ensure total control and absolute loyalty from all that reside within the Reich. We must expand the SS's watching eyes into every corner of society. By increasing their numbers and authority over society and everyday life we are united with an unbreakable chain of loyalty and fear with the most devoted and fanatical Aryans being in the SS. This expansion will put us one step closer to destruction and total annihilation of the Judeo-Bolsheviks and Capitalists as well as Political Dissidents and those who oppose the mighty Reichsführer-SS and the Aryan."

The succesor to the reins of the German Nation will be Erich von Ludendorff, one of the most experienced generals in the OHL.

Choosing him would certainly be a wise decision despite all the rumours about him and his secret masterplan."

He wishes to make our economy better in the future and believes that we are strong enough to show our past enemies that we don't know when to stop and we will keep trying to become a Major Power on the World Stage. He seems to be a good candidate for a Leader for a country like Germany. The Iron Cross shall shine above all our enemies, letting them know that we are back for more!"

 WRD_the_old_kaiser_desc: "The truth is that no one could ever lead Germany better than its rightful Kaiser, Wilhelm II of Hohenzollern. We must end the regency and had the reigns over him. He is the legitimate ruler of this country, let's not betray our values. We will help him achieve unification, but he has to be at the head. After all, his experience from the Prewar Era and the Weltkrieg are priceless and could make him the most experienced leader in the German wasteland."

Many people grew disgruntled with the whole idea of a monarchy and some even started to sympathize with dangerous ideologies, such as Bolshevism. To save the perception of monarchism, we need a brand new Kaiser on the throne who will achieve the Wiedervereinigung and forge a more perfect union between German states.

 WRD_increase_working_hours_desc: "To achieve our high-standard goals and ambitious and continued growth in industrial efficiency and productivity which will highly benefit the Aryan nation. we must demand higher productivity and standards the workers of the Fatherland, especially from Untermensch. This will highly bolster our industrial output when war comes and accelerate our arms production rapidly allowing for the Schutzstaffel’s growth.

With our state-of-the-art weapons, we may be able to inflict swift and decisive victories on the traitors of the German people.

We are stepping into unknown waters only time will tell what the final fate of the German people however it is bright and prosperous for with blood and death comes victory.

This final victory is shrouded in great uncertainty when we approach an era of conflict and death. Here you win or you die! The shadow of the Reichsführer-SS’s vision of a Aryan Realm has become more real than ever with our destiny being our greatest victory or worst disaster leading to ruin. Our path forward will be filled with mines and holes that may cause our ship to finally come to a halt. However, with the help of our Heroic Reichsführer-SS Himmler we will see the final victory come to reality and the flag of the Tausendjähriges Reich fly in the cold breeze of Berlin. From now on the path that may elevate us to the gates of victory and triumph or plunge into an unrecoverable dead end where the Aryan race will go extinct along with all that we have worked and died for.

 WRD_permanent_martial_law_desc: "The Weltkrieg has proven that unless radical measures are taken, a nation is doomed to fail against its enemys. This mistake cost us our empire. Many called us totalitarian for our policies during the last few years of the Weltkrieg. They are wrong. Instead, those who advocated a total transformation of the German nation through pure germanic discipline were the ones who spoke the truth. If we want to build a prosperous superior German Reich again, we will have to take radical measures. As a start, we will extend the so called temporary martial law to be permanent. And we won't hide this from the people. We are Germans. We are better than the other peoples of the world, and the world must tremble under our feet.

Anyone who speaks against these measures will be sent to Deutsch-Ostafrika for penal work after we have restored the Vaterland to its former glory.

A party most of the people in our country hate are all the socialist branches, promising a greater red future for our Empire. All they say are lies! They want us to end up like Russia, broken state full of smaller warlord-like countries! We must not fall to the socialists, and discriminate their party before they get an idea of an revolution.

Every German is tired of constant war and this civil war. We must promise the people that peace will rule for the next few decades and that we will ensure their safety."
 WRD_keep_the_radicals_out: "Keep the Radicals Out"
 WRD_keep_the_radicals_out_desc: "Many radicals are trying to ruin the safety of the German people. We must make sure they are all in prison or out of the country in order to prevent terrorist attacks or entire revolutions. This is no place for radicalism, nor a time for it either."
 WRD_trust_in_the_kaiser: "Trust in the Kaiser"
 WRD_trust_in_the_kaiser_desc: "Finnaly, after long political discussions with the People, getting the Kaiser more power over the Leadership and fixing the economy of Wehrkommando Düsseldorf, the people, finnaly fully trust us. We can now focus on bringing back the old glory of the German Empire and finnaly unify all of Germany under one State, once and for all! We can not make the German People think that Germany is no more for the world and that all there is are just states fightning for power, we must and we shall unite all of it under one country, one party, one Kaiser..."
 WRD_murder_the_bolshevik_degenerates: "Murder the Bolshevik Degenerates"
 WRD_murder_the_bolshevik_degenerates_desc: "While our brave German troops fought on the frontlines, protecting the Vaterland, the Bolshevist degenerates stabbed them in the back at the hinterlands by strikes, inciting desertions, slandering the monarchy, and planting the harmful ideas of the old fool, Karl Marx, in the population's minds. We should purge these pests from our lands, and without their destructive activities, Germany can achieve world dominance free from degenerate ideologies."
 WRD_every_revolution_has_a_reaction: "Every Revolution has a Reaction..."
 WRD_every_revolution_has_a_reaction_desc: "Now that we have a Kaiser on the throne again, we should consolidate our power, similarly to Bismarck in our previous empire. A strong state is only possible under a strong leader with absolute powers, so he can guide us to greatness once again without him being hindered by useless and harmful political entities, such as "parliament" and "elections". Der Staat, ich bin es!"
 WRD_promise_revenge_for_the_weltkrieg: "Promise Revenge for the Weltkrieg"
 WRD_promise_revenge_for_the_weltkrieg_desc: "Our perfect union of the German people fell apart thanks to the interfering Entente powers, thus robbing Germany from its imperial glory and important, almost even dominant place in the world stage. Vengeance is our only path towards restoring our respected Empire, and the people should know their enemies and more importantly, hate them with a burning passion. When the time comes, we will burn Paris and London to the ground!"
 WRD_first_the_german_kaiserreich_back_on_the_world_stage: "The German Kaiserreich Back on the World Stage"
 WRD_first_the_german_kaiserreich_back_on_the_world_stage_desc: "Now that Germany is fully under the Kaiserreich and its loyal army’s banner, we can focus on the world outside of our nation. We shall continue our imperial programs from before the war, and make our enemies of the past bend the knee to us. Long live our glorious nation!"
 WRD_first_restore_the_intercontinental_empire: "Restore the Intercontinental Empire"
 WRD_first_restore_the_intercontinental_empire_desc: "Leading up to the Great War, Germany’s foreign policy focused on colonisation primarily in the Asian and African continents. Our inability to unify before the renaissance and the dawn of European colonialism made it very difficult to acquire meaningful colonies, but with the British Empire now crippled, opportunities are plentiful."
 WRD_first_support_deutschostafrika: "Support Deutsch-Ostafrika"
 WRD_first_support_deutschostafrika_desc: "Ever since the Fall of the Kaiserreich, Paul Lettow Von-Vorbeck has fought bravely to continue the German rule in Ostafrika. He is one of our most loyal men, having fought to preserve our legacy in the region. Now that Deutsch-Ostafrika is part of the empire once again, we shall support their army with guns and money so that they can strenghten the German grip on the region."
 WRD_first_into_south_africa: "Go Into South Africa"
 WRD_first_into_south_africa_desc: "With the fall of British imperialism, South Africa now finds itself isolated, with no foreign support it is undoubtedly struggling to hold onto its unstable territories. This presents the perfect opportunity for us. With Ostafrika now under our dominion, we can quickly stage an amphibious attack and bring Cape Town into the fold."
 WRD_first_establish_a_yemenese_protectorate: "Establish a Yemenese Protectorate"
 WRD_first_establish_a_yemenese_protectorate_desc: "Yemen, a nation in the south-west of the Arabian peninsula, is a nation that has remained largely undeveloped into the 20th century. Conquering them would provide us a useful post with which we can colonise the Middle East further, and have increased control over the Indian Ocean. Some think there may even be exploitable resources available under the ground, as the land has not yet been explored with extractionary technology."
 WRD_first_accostumed_to_every_climate: "Accostumed to Every Climate"
 WRD_first_accostumed_to_every_climate_desc: "With our colonial empire now stretching far and wide, we have many climates to travel through that our colonial army must learn to become accustomed to. We will focus on developing clothing and other items our soldiers can use to become more used to the tropical climates of Asia and Africa."
 WRD_first_buy_papua_new_guinea_back: "Buy Papua New Guinea Back"
 WRD_first_buy_papua_new_guinea_back_desc: "Following the Great War, Australia was awarded Papua New Guinea for their efforts. Now with their overlords, the British, gone though, Australia is relatively isolated from the rest of the world and, we have no reason to be hostile towards them, and we hope they would say the same. Although relations between our nations are far from warm, with enough money, we might just be able to buy our former colony back."
 WRD_first_trade_deal_with_japan: "Trade Deal with Japan"
 WRD_first_trade_deal_with_japan_desc: "The Japanese Empire, a rapidly modernising state that is looking more and more likely to become a Great Power, would be a very strategically useful ally. Despite being enemies in the Great War, our diplomats suggest reaching out to them with a trade offer to improve our two countries’ relationship."
 WRD_first_take_over_malaysia: "Take Over Malaysia"
 WRD_first_take_over_malaysia_desc: "With our dominion now stretching to Papua New Guinea once again, the opportunity has been opened to seize Malaysia, a land extremely rich in resources. Taking it will greatly benefit our glorious Kaiserreich."
 WRD_first_reestablish_the_kriegsmarine: "Re-Establish the Kriegsmarine"
 WRD_first_reestablish_the_kriegsmarine_desc: "Ten years ago, our navy was the most powerful in the world. We challenged the British rule of the Seas and dominated the oceans. However, our navy has largely been destroyed. We need to re-establish our naval legacy in order to be able to compete on the world stage against the other powers who seek to destroy us- and they will try."
 WRD_first_establish_the_reichspakt: "Establish the Reichspakt"
 WRD_first_establish_the_reichspakt_desc: "With our return to the international stage, we must begin the road to becoming Europe’s number one power by creating an strong military and economic alliance. The nations of the Reichspakt shall prosper under our glorious leadership."
 WRD_first_demand_northern_schleswig: "Demand Northern Schleswig"
 WRD_first_demand_northern_schleswig_desc: "At the end of the war, the Danish Kingdom was given Northern Schleswig, a core territory of the empire. We shall give the Danes the chance to hand over the German land peacefully; if they refuse, though, we shall simply have to crush them like the weak ants they are."
 WRD_first_retake_east_prussia: "Retake East Prussia"
 WRD_first_retake_east_prussia_desc: "This country was united by the House of Hohenzollern which started in Prussia. Nowadays, these lands are under the control of the tyrant Mikhail Tukhachevsky, who is a bolshevik and servant of the Great Satan in Moscow. We must liberate the German people living there from his regime through force of arms. Any negotiation with the bolshevik scum will inevitably fail, so we have no other choice but to use force."
 WRD_first_revenge_for_the_weltkrieg: "Revenge for the Weltkrieg"
 WRD_first_revenge_for_the_weltkrieg_desc: "Millions of young German men gave their lives to their nation, fighting the evil French on the Western Front. All that fighting, only for their country to fall into chaos for years… we shall not let it stand any longer. We shall inflict the same pain the French did on our nation, and make the martyrs proud. Down with the bastards!"
 WRD_first_end_the_bolshevik_threat: "End the Bolshevik Threat"
 WRD_first_end_the_bolshevik_threat_desc: "The Russians to our East have always been a thorn in our side, their massive empire presenting a threat directly on our border, but their years-long civil war has severely weakened them. With the west secured, we shall invade Russia and establish puppet regimes in the east.  Long live the Kaiser and the empire! Long live Germany!"
 WRD_first_ally_the_iberians: "Ally the Iberians"
 WRD_first_ally_the_iberians_desc: "The Spanish and Portuguese nations both provide useful bases in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. Allying them would benefit our alliance and stabilise our hegemony over Western Europe."
 WRD_first_offer_the_irish_protection: "Offer the Irish Protection"
 WRD_first_offer_the_irish_protection_desc: "The Irish people are one of the most resilient on the face of the planet. They fought bravely for their freedom against the British and are now once again under threat because of the Fullerite regime. We will offer them entry into the Reichspakt and protection so that they may overcome these challenges and grow to become a prosperous country. On top of that, Ireland will be a very strategic spot for us to launch operations against our old enemies."
 WRD_first_reinvite_the_old_allies: "Reinvite the Old Allies"
 WRD_first_reinvite_the_old_allies_desc: "In the Weltkrieg, we fought as a part of the Zentralmächte. All of our allies were loyal and disciplines. Among them were Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary. The reasons we lost were beyond us. However, we must embrace our common legacy and take revenge on those who stole our freedom and killed our children. We will reinvite our old allies to be a part of the new Reichspakt alliance we established earlier."
 WRD_purge_the_unworthy_of_the_reich: "Eliminate the Red Plague from German Society"
 WRD_purge_the_unworthy_of_the_reich_desc: "We have to clean our society of those who are not willing to work to make the New German Reich into a prosperous empire to dominate the world for a thousand years. Those who do not work must die. We will deport homeless people, they provide no benefit to society. All bolsheviks and rebels will also have to leave immedieately. Germany will be pure and clean of foreign, laziness-inducing degenerates."
