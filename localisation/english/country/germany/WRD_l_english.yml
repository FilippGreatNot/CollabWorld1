 ### Focuses ###
 WRD_first_catastrophe_of_the_weltkrieg: "The Catastrophe of the Weltkrieg"
 WRD_first_catastrophe_of_the_weltkrieg_desc: "The Great War has been lost and our government has nearly collapsed. We were able to retain a bit of control in the west with our armed forces, who are collapsing too. Everything is going badly and if we don't change course, our complete rule will collapse and the monarchist dream will be destroyed. Maybe hope remains for the fatherland to finally be restored to its former royal glory..."
 WRD_first_reorganise_government_institutions: "Reorganise Government Institutions"
  WRD_first_reorganise_government_institutions_desc: "Due to the war, our institutions have become frail and corrupt. They can't continue functioning like this lest we take a bullet in the fight to reunite the homeland. It is our duty to bring security to the Vaterland by reforming the bureaucracy of the nation."
 WRD_first_provisional_martial_law: "Provisional Martial Law"
 WRD_first_provisional_martial_law_desc: "We have noticed that there is simply too much unorder in our society to tolerate. We must get rid of all the scum that tries to harm the German Vaterland and the only way we can properly do that is by immedieately establishing provisional martial law. We should probably get rid of it later on in order to keep the nation stable but if we want to, there would technically be nothing stopping us from keeping it..."
 WRD_first_restore_public_trust_desc: "The losses of our state have been way too many. We lost a war and we even lost the control of the country. The only thing that remains is our little rump warlord establishment west of the Rhine. It is understandable that the public doesn't trust our governance anymore. We have to change this by restoring public trust first in order to keep the society secure and free of socialist or any revolutionary ideals. This has a higher priority than repairing our standing in the international community."
 WRD_first_restore_public_trust: "Restore Public Trust"
 WRD_first_introduce_economic_austerity: "Introduce Economic Austerity"
 WRD_first_introduce_economic_austerity_desc: "The war has left our economy in utter shambles. We must immedieately introduce EVEN MORE economic austerity in order to keep our entire empire from collapsing. Well... I guess its not an empire anymore but regardless. The reformists in the military administration are criticizing this move as they say that this will provoke even further socialist strife, but I can't really care about the opinion of the traitors of the Vaterland. After all, without their stupid betreyal we wouldn't have lost the war in the first place. Our victory was inevitable!"
 WRD_first_end_the_december_mutiny: "End the December Munity"
 WRD_first_end_the_december_mutiny_desc: "Many batallions within the military and even within the Royal Schutzstaffel have started mutinies a bit before christmas in order to completely destabilize and destroy our way of life. This will not persist, we will get rid of all military mutineers and get the KSS mutineers to stop by negotiating with them. This mutiny continuing would probably end our chances of ever reuniting Germany."
 WRD_first_ask_for_an_exchange_of_pows: "Ask for an Exchange of POWs"
 WRD_first_ask_for_an_exchange_of_pows_desc: "We still have many French Prisoners of War, and truly they have just become a trouble for our state as they cost to feed. A smart move would probably be to exchange POWs with the new government in Paris, perhaps they have a brain and will grant us this little deal in these times of strife for both of our countries."
 WRD_first_fight_for_international_recognition: "Fight for International Recognition"
 WRD_first_fight_for_international_recognition_desc: "The opinion of the public does not concern us. They will not trust us anymore no matter what we do. Appeasing them is a lost cause. We should try to cooperate with the international community and get them to fully recognize us as the legitimate rulers of Germany. Many of them might get funny ideas of supporting the evil Spartakusbund or the corrupt Hamburg Republic. We must not allow this to happen."
 WRD_first_beaten_but_not_defeated_desc: "Despite the complete collapse of the Kaiserreich in the Great War, we have still come out victorious- well not victorious- but we survived. Now it is the time to decide on our future after the stabilization and to reunite the German Vaterland under the Kaiser once again... but there are rumours of a coup lurking from one of the usually more loyal elements of the state. Who could it be?"
 WRD_first_beaten_but_not_defeated: "Beaten, but Not Defeated!"
