 FWG_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The Free German Syndicates, or the Free German Communes, are a confederation of a variety of primarily socialist parties and factions that arose as a manifestation of a Greater worker's state, with the combination of a more violent Ruhr worker's uprising, and a significantly more potent Bremen Soviet Republic and others. When Governmental forces were pushed out, these two warring factions combined together due to compatible ideologies, and became a basis for resettlement of many Socialist activists seeking refuge, be it in West Germany, or in Western Europe in general."

 ### Focuses ###
 ## START AND POLITICAL ##
 FWG_fate_of_the_junkers: "Fate of the Junkers"
 FWG_fate_of_the_junkers_desc: "We will start to take action against the subversive and secretive landowning class that are hiding beneath us, making a shame of our identity, and going against everything we vy for. We hope that by contributing to the first efforts in dealing with this early, it will be a catalyst to prevent any development of the state into a Soviet-like society with state capitalism as its economic helm, a harrowing structure that can only bring anguish to the average labourer."
 FWG_public_mining_works: "Public Mining Works"
 FWG_public_mining_works_desc: "We will begin organising a series of syndicates specialised in optimising the needs of the average miner, increase mining efficiency by cutting bureaucratic slop, and by opening new mines in areas with low employment, bringing back life to those areas."
 FWG_evict_imperial_loyalists: "Evict Imperial Loyalists"
 FWG_evict_imperial_loyalists_desc: "Within our territories, there still lie a flurry of those loyal to the Regime of old, especially to our south, where we border the troublesome Wehrkommando. We need to remind these gangs that they are not welcome to stay! We will pass eviction orders to those suspected of having ties to either the Freiwilingenkorps, the Der Stahlhelm, or the KSS, as well as anyone who still maintains a glint of Royalty."
 FWG_recruit_more_militias: "Recruit More Militias"
 FWG_recruit_more_militias_desc: "At the point where the Sea and the lands of Germany meet, it is not unespected to witness a large number of volunteers and foreign legions, German or Socialist, to act on our behalf and fight for the Revolution. We shall officialise this process by conscripting them into our arms forces, as well as absorbing other paramilitary groups we, ourselves are allied to."
 FWG_the_backbone_of_a_nation: "The Backbone of a Nation"
 FWG_the_backbone_of_a_nation_desc: "Without a proper, functioning industry, a state cannot function, and we are no exception. While we may vary politically and ideologically to other states, we are still very much dependant on the same resources. We will use whatever resources we have to develop our local industries and begin increasing our industrial capabilities."
 FWG_our_swords_and_shields: "Our Swords and Shields"
 FWG_the_congress_of_1922: "The Congress of 1922"
 FWG_merges: "Victory of the Council-Syndicalists"
 FWG_ruhle: "Victory of AAU-E"
 FWG_rocker: "Victory of the FAUD anarchists"
 FWG_kosch: "Victory of the Western Marxists"

 ## INDUSTRY ##
 FWG_begin_early_industrial_expansion: "Begin Early Industrial Expansion"
 FWG_begin_early_industrial_expansion_desc: "The Weser and northern Westfalia are not particularly known for their large industry. With the exception of the Bremerhaven, Cuxhaven, Emden and Wilhelmshaven ports in the North, and the rich Ruhr in the South, much of the area is reliant on agriculture. If we want to outlast our adversaries, we need to begin a nation-wide expansion of existing industrial faculties, and the restoration of damaged ones, this is in order to provide space for newer industries and to provide a launchpad for other projects."
 FWG_develop_the_oldenburg_docks: "Develop the Oldenburg Docks"
 FWG_develop_the_oldenburg_docks_desc: "The area belonging to the Oldenburg commune has several key cities, but is primarily known for its grandeur port of Wilhelmshaven, one of the most crucial points in our entire powerbase. Its distance to the north sea is unlike any other, only beaten by ports with the likes of Emden, which are smaller, or Hamburg, which is further away. We must capitalise on the gift given to us by sheer geography by funding an expansion of the Wilhelmshaven port and its nearby facilities."
 FWG_move_industry_away_from_the_vulnerable_ruhr: "Move Industry Away From the Vulnerable Ruhr"
 FWG_expand_the_local_mining_works: "Expand the Local Mining Works"

 FWG_streamline_weapons_manufacturing: "Streamline Weapons Manufacturing"
 FWG_fortify_the_southern_border: "Fortify the Southern Border"

 ### Ideas ###
 FWG_the_exploitative_junkers: "The Exploitative Junkers"
 FWG_the_exploitative_junkers_desc: "As our state was formed, many leftists fled to our powerbase as a secure, catch-all bloc against the repressive reactionary regimes to our south and the anti-radicalist Government to our east. With these came Junkers, wealthy landowners, aligning themselves under a socialist agenda, but really being a part of a secret capitalist class, actively taking part in services that our laws deem illegal. It is time we stop this nonsense!"
 FWG_the_weakened_junkers: "The Weakened Junkers"
 FWG_the_weakened_junkers_desc: "With the passing of our first laws of the new year, the policies that were meant to keep the Junkers in line finally caught up with them. Many individuals suspected of being anti-socialist have been arrested or policed, but there are still many more left unchecked by both us and the public eye, we should keep looking!"
 FWG_public_mining_works_idea: "§8Public Mining Works§!"
 FWG_public_mining_works_idea_desc: "With the first steps taken to reach industrial self-sustainability well underway, it will only be a matter of time before we can fully recover! These are small steps, but they count to large actions that we will take in the future."
 FWG_public_mining_works_idea2: "§8Public Mining Works§!"
 FWG_public_mining_works_idea2_desc: "With the first steps taken to reach industrial self-sustainability well underway, it will only be a matter of time before we can fully recover! These are small steps, but they count to large actions that we will take in the future."
 FWG_effects_from_the_rotflucht: "Effects from the Rotflucht"
 FWG_effects_from_the_rotflucht_desc: "The Rotflucht is the ongoing flight of several thousands of socialist revolutionaries from Western countries under authoritarian or reactionary regimes. It poses as a consequence of one of many illiberal domestic policies imposed by countries like Britain and France, and, as a result, gives us greater and greater swathes of manpower to choose from. Our ready access to the sea and therefore the ocean is the reason why we are the primary beneficiaries of this issue."
 FWG_multiethnic_army: "Multi-ethnic Army"
 FWG_multiethnic_army_desc: "Our forces are, as of the current moment, composed of a series of local militias, foreign legions, desertees from the Heer and a multitude of Volunteer brigades. It is, at this moment, that we are having issues communicating with them all, be it with a lack of radio, or their inability to speak a Common Tongue."
 FWG_multiethnic_army2: "Multi-ethnic Army"
 FWG_multiethnic_army2_desc: "Our forces are, as of the current moment, composed of a series of local militias, foreign legions, desertees from the Heer and a multitude of Volunteer brigades. It is, at this moment, that we are having issues communicating with them all, be it with a lack of radio, or their inability to speak a Common Tongue."

 ### Events ###

 fwg.1.t: "The landowning class"
 fwg.1.d: "Germany, historically, has been dominated by both military matters, and matters surrounding the needs of the Landowning class, or the Junkers. But they are a plague to our nation. Price-gouging, lower working standards and a lack of communication with the lower classes has lead many people to object to their rule, like us, the syndicates, the voices of the people. We must start our own dekulakisation process to end this blight that has infested our lands."
 fwg.1.a: "Land und Freiheit"
 
 fwg.2.t: "The Congress of 1922"
 fwg.2.d: "The Congress is electing a new leader, but who will it be? It is time to decide in the congress of 1922!"
