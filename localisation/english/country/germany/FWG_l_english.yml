 FWG_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The Free German Syndicates, or the Free German Communes, are a confederation of a variety of primarily socialist parties and factions that arose as a manifestation of a Greater worker's state, with the combination of a more violent Ruhr worker's uprising, and a significantly more potent Bremen Soviet Republic and others. When Governmental forces were pushed out, these two warring factions combined together due to compatible ideologies, and became a basis for resettlement of many Socialist activists seeking refuge, be it in West Germany, or in Western Europe in general."

 ## Start and political ##

 FWG_fate_of_the_junkers_desc: "We will start to take action against the subversive and secretive landowning class that are hiding beneath us, making a shame of our identity, and going against everything we vy for. We hope that by contributing to the first efforts in dealing with this early, it will be a catalyst to prevent any development of the state into a Soviet-like society with state capitalism as its economic helm, a harrowing structure that can only bring anguish to the average labourer."
 FWG_public_mining_works: "Public Mining Works"
 FWG_public_mining_works_desc: "We will begin organising a series of syndicates specialised in optimising the needs of the average miner, increase mining efficiency by cutting bureaucratic slop, and by opening new mines in areas with low employment, bringing back life to those areas."
 FWG_evict_imperial_loyalists: "Evict Imperial Loyalists"
 FWG_evict_imperial_loyalists_desc: "Within our territories, there still lie a flurry of those loyal to the Regime of old, especially to our south, where we border the troublesome Wehrkommando. We need to remind these gangs that they are not welcome to stay! We will pass eviction orders to those suspected of having ties to either the Freiwilingenkorps, the Der Stahlhelm, or the KSS, as well as anyone who still maintains a glint of Royalty."
 FWG_recruit_more_militias: "Recruit More Militias"
 FWG_recruit_more_militias_desc: "At the point where the Sea and the lands of Germany meet, it is not unespected to witness a large number of volunteers and foreign legions, German or Socialist, to act on our behalf and fight for the Revolution. We shall officialise this process by conscripting them into our arms forces, as well as absorbing other paramilitary groups we, ourselves are allied to."

 FWG_the_backbone_of_a_nation_desc: "Without a proper, functioning industry, a state cannot function, and we are no exception.

With the exception of the Bremerhaven, Cuxhaven, Emden and Wilhelmshaven ports in the North, and the rich Ruhr in the South, much of the area is reliant on agriculture. If we want to outlast our adversaries, we need to begin a nation-wide expansion of existing industrial faculties, and the restoration of damaged ones, this is in order to provide space for newer industries and to provide a launchpad for other projects."

Its distance to the north sea is unlike any other, only beaten by ports with the likes of Emden, which are smaller, or Hamburg, which is further away. We must capitalise on the gift given to us by sheer geography by funding an expansion of the Wilhelmshaven port and its nearby facilities."

 ### Ideas ###

 FWG_the_exploitative_junkers: "The Exploitative Junkers"
 FWG_the_exploitative_junkers_desc: "As our state was formed, many leftists fled to our powerbase as a secure, catch-all bloc against the repressive reactionary regimes to our south and the anti-radicalist Government to our east. With these came Junkers, wealthy landowners, aligning themselves under a socialist agenda, but really being a part of a secret capitalist class, actively taking part in services that our laws deem illegal. It is time we stop this nonsense!"
 FWG_the_weakened_junkers: "The Weakened Junkers"
 FWG_the_weakened_junkers_desc: "With the passing of our first laws of the new year, the policies that were meant to keep the Junkers in line finally caught up with them. Many individuals suspected of being anti-socialist have been arrested or policed, but there are still many more left unchecked by both us and the public eye, we should keep looking!"
 FWG_the_powerless_junkers: "The Powerless Junkers"
 FWG_the_powerless_junkers_desc: "No more shall these ills roam our lands, for once, they have been locked up or controlled. Once one of the largest threats to our realm, are now simple men sitting in cells. Large corporations, reduced to properties of local labour and trade unions. So much money, now is well-spent on public projects. You would never have guessed how large their smiles were, as, for the first time, there are, instead, frowns."

It poses as a consequence of one of many illiberal domestic policies imposed by countries like Britain and France, and, as a result, gives us greater and greater swathes of manpower to choose from. Our ready access to the sea and therefore the ocean is the reason why we are the primary beneficiaries of this issue."

 ### Events ###

 fwg.1.t: "The landowning class"
 fwg.1.d: "Germany, historically, has been dominated by both military matters, and matters surrounding the needs of the Landowning class, or the Junkers. But they are a plague to our nation. Price-gouging, lower working standards and a lack of communication with the lower classes has lead many people to object to their rule, like us, the syndicates, the voices of the people. We must start our own dekulakisation process to end this blight that has infested our lands."
 fwg.1.a: "Land und Freiheit"
 fwg.2.t: "The Congress of 1922"
 fwg.2.d: "The Congress is electing a new leader, but who will it be? It is time to decide in the congress of 1922!"
 fwg.2.a: "Henke"
 fwg.2.b: "Rühle"
 fwg.2.c: "Rocker"
 fwg.2.e: "Korsch"
 fwg.3.t: "The Syndicates offer an investment opportunity"
 fwg.3.d: "blah blah blah"
 fwg.3.a: "No! Frick off with that stuff. We won't be supporting any reds, no matter their shade."
 fwg.3.b: "At this point its best not to get on the wrong side of the Germans..."
 fwg.4.t: "The Dutch Reject!"
 fwg.4.d: "These goshdarn swamp germans rejected our offer of FREE political power for FREE factories and now we are so upset!"
 fwg.4.a: "Appropiate response"
 fwg.5.t: "The Dutch Accept!"
 fwg.5.d: "At least there is a description here, right?"
 fwg.5.a: "We will now reap the benefits of such a deal"
 fwg.6.t: "Today's speech in Bremen"
 fwg.6.d: "A battle is not only to be fought physically, with swords and guns, men and bullets, fields and mass-graves, but also with ideology and the mind. We cannot allow our minds to be influenced by the devils of capitalism parading around as representatives of the German nation. No such thing shall suffice! We will never fall to their twisted systems and their imperialist, reactionary kings they call chancellors and presidents, no. We will go beyond this, we will survive the onslaught and bring upon a new era for what it means to be German!"
 fwg.6.a: "Beyond the needs for a nation, is the need to defend yourself."
 fwg.7.t: "Announcing rapid mobilisation"
 fwg.7.a: "We need more men!"
 fwg.8.t: "The Syndicates offer a pact of Non-Aggression"
 fwg.8.a: "Accept"
 fwg.8.b: "Reject"
 fwg.9.t: "What it means to be a worker"
 fwg.9.a: "The system must be as much of an organism as are its employees"
 fwg.10.t: "Introduction to the Anti-Bolshevik Rhetoric mechanic"
 fwg.10.d: "Every time Korsch publishes a book or releases a speech, the Rhetoric's effects will be increased, they can range from a simple anti-bolshevik rift at the beginning, to a lot of stronger buffs later on. This is due to Korsch's nature, both OTL and in-game, as a vibrant anti-soviet and as such a 'dissident' of the left wing of communism. He is strongly opposed to the authoritarian policies imposed by marxism-leninism, and even opposed Stalinism. This mechanic is meant to visualise this fact."
 fwg.10.a: "I sure hope nothing bad will ever happen"
 fwg.11.t: "Effects of our industrialisation project"
 fwg.11.d: "Our industrialisation scheme has resulted in a slew of positive outcomes, including the development of new industrialisation centres in various oiirer parts of our country. This will greatly help with our unemployment crisis and increase our industrial potential."
 fwg.11.a: "If more people are working then less have to work as much."
 fwg.12.t: "March on Bremen"
 fwg.12.d: "The KPD leader, Hugo Eberlein, has marched on our capital, Bremen, to attempt a Bolshevik coup! He does not pose much of a threat due to his low support, but he is still a major issue to the security of our state. What shall we do?"
 fwg.12.a: "His coup is crushed!"
 fwg.12.b: "The council panics, and the present leader resigns"
 fwg.13.t: "Bolshevik coup in Bremen"
 fwg.13.d: "On this morning, a force of approximately 3,000 men, with the backing of the Spartakusbund behind them, have successfully mounted a coup in the Free German Syndicates, forming a Bolshevik government that replaced the Syndicalist one. This comes at a moment very soon after its 1922 Congress, where the results were not favored by opposing factions and thus a coup has been sprung."
 fwg.13.a: "The Syndicates have died, the United German Soviets are Born!"

 # For Korsch

 korsch.1.t: "§RMarxism And Philosophy (1923)§!"
 korsch.1.d: "In §OMarxism and Philosophy§!, Korsch argues for a reexamination of the relationship between Marxist theory and bourgeois philosophy, and insists on the centrality of the Hegelian dialectic and a commitment to revolutionary praxis. Although widely attacked in its time, Marxism and Philosophy has attained a place among the most important works of twentieth-century Marxist theory, and continues to merit critical reappraisal from scholars and activists today."
 korsch.2.t: "A Speech In Emden"
 korsch.2.d: "Comrades, Compatriots, do not worry! For the evils that constitute the basis of Soviet society will eventually collapse in on themselves, and I KNOW IT! You shouldn't trust me, you should trust yourself; Do you think a revolution can last as long as the Soviets with their inherently broken model? Their Authoritarianism and their foreign policy alleging to antagonise every nation bordering them? Do you not see? The leninist revolution is bound, not only by my own words, but nature's, to FAIL!"
 korsch.2.a: "Every nation they conquer is a drop in a sea of delinquency"
 korsch.3.t: "Korsch's Vision for Germany"
 korsch.3.d: "Gather round, gather round. I have come to tell you that, upon the unification of our nation, I have developed a concept that might help us garner attention, not only from other revolutionary comrades, but even from the bastardly soviets themselves! It comes in a simple form; instead of proclaiming a Syndicate Union, we form a Soviet Union. Not one that is bound by any national divisions, but by communities and the nations that we border. The revolution must be a lit flame that should never go out, and as such, we will have to go on the offensive, first."
 korsch.3.a: "There should be no other Union of Soviets but ours."
 korsch.4.t: "Korsch releases a Statement on Lenin"
 korsch.4.d: "At long last, one of our finest adversaries, Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, has died after succumbing to his injuries after suffering a sudden stroke. A revolutionary, but alas, a leader of a dictatorship, we must now prepare ourselves for what is to come. Lenin was merely a moderate; There are other people in his party that want our heads, and we will not be the ones dying this time around! Beware, a stalinist takeover could easily vest enough worry to ravage an entire nation, so let us not be the ones that panic!"
 korsch.4.a: "To face your greatest fear you must be the one to fight it"
