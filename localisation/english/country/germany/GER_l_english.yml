 ### Events ###
 deutschlandmain.1.t: "Return to the Capital"
 deutschlandmain.1.d: "Now that we have seized back control of Berlin, we will once again embrace it as our capital now and forever! All of Germany must rejoice, for we are back in our Home!"
 deutschlandmain.1.a: "Welcome to Berlin!"
 
 ger.1.t: "Victory in Berlin"
 ger.1.d: "After months of fighting in Eastern Germany, the frontlines in the civil war against the Spartakusbund have become stale. The last recent Battle, the Battle of Berlin, ended in a Republican victory. The spartacists fought very effectively and we lost a lot of men in the battle, even in the last days. However, now Berlin is fully under the control of our government. Finally we can rest and attempt to fix some internal issues before going on the quest to stabilize Germany and end all the different revolutions across the Fatherland. A Free Germany will arise from the ashes, like a phoenix."
 ger.1.a: "Some Peace At Last"
 ger.2.t: "Disssolving the Reichstag"
 ger.2.d: "Friedrich hates instability. He had hoped that with the victory in Berlin, the situation across the country would calm down and that Germany would be ableto enjoy a bit more internal peace. Instead, the DNVP and Zentrum have seized the opportunity to weaken the SPD and to get new supporters. Now, massive demonstrations are going on across the country and the situation could escalate easily. Friedrich Ebert has been forced to hold a Snap Election, even though it was the last thing he wanted to do. Tommorow, this will be the main news headline across the nation. Who will win? Time will tell. Either way, Ebert stays."
 ger.2.a: "Destiny Approaches"
 ger.3.t: "The Reichstagswahl Begins"
 ger.3.d: "Our snap parliamentary election has begun. People have begun going to the ballot. Some cases of violence have been reported in major cities but generally the election has been generally peaceful. However, there was a major case in Erfurt where the Reichswehr attempted to manipulate the election in favor of the DNVP, revealing a deep-entrenched plot. This just shows that we really need to clean the military and make sure it is loyal to the constitution. Otherwise, they will ultimately become the biggest threat to German democracy and might want to align with the Wehrkommand or the Freikorps if we go to battle with them to reunify the nation. Soon, it will be clear who won. The DNVP... Zentrum... or the SPD... And the winner is..."
 ger.3.a: "The SPD Holds!"
 ger.3.b: "A Christian Democratic Victory"
 ger.3.c: "The DNVP builds a conservative coalition."
 ger.4.t: "Friedrich Ebert Dead, New Presidential Elections Called"
 ger.4.d: "Our president, a fighter for German Democracy and member of the SPD, Friedrich Ebert, has unfortunately passed away of a septic shock after having been ill for months on end. These are unfortunate news, but now we must call a New Presidential election and elect a new president for the German Republic."
 ger.4.a: "Otto Braun(SPD)"
 ger.4.b: "Wilhelm Marx(Zentrum)"
 ger.4.c: "Karl Jarres(DVP)"
 ger.4.e: "Alfred Hughenberg(DNVP)"
 ger.5.t: "Acting in the Shadows"
 ger.5.d: "There are rumours of a secret organization acting behind the shadows of the public scene across the Republic. They perform assasionations, funnel funds, support nationalist media outlets and have agents in high positions. Our own detectives have identified it as the so called Vril Society. They have very esoteric beliefs, which we do not understand that clearly yet. Regardless, we must make a choice. We can either stop their operations and arrest the organization's members and trial them for British Espionage. The other options would be to just let them operate... but this could have fatal consequences if the republic becomes unstable."
 ger.5.a: "No Secret Organizations Here!"
 ger.5.b: "Interesting, allow them to operate."
 ger.6.t: "A Detente with France?"
 ger.6.d: "Many people within our military think that cooperating with the New French Regime, while it would be a very unpopular move, might make us stronger and give us new weapons to be able to reunify the nation quicker than expected. Members of the party have criticized the proposal and call it betrayal due to our party's stance towards France. However, a new guard is slowly appearing seeking better relations with the French State."
 ger.6.a: "No Cooperation with Snail Eaters!"
 ger.6.b: "It is neccesary"
 ger.7.t: "The Troublesome Strasser Brother"
 ger.7.d: "Well... both are troublesome... but only one of them is a trouble for us. The Northern DNBAP, while weaker than their southern counterpart, is definitely a significant threat to the Republic's stability and to the safety of the German people. We must deal with them, possibly by arresting Otto Strasser. We could also just do nothing and hope for the best..."
 ger.7.a: "Let's wait"
 ger.7.b: "Arrest that Son of a Bitch!"
 ger.69.t: "Vril Society Takeover."
 ger.69.d: "An obscure society-once dismissed as mystic eccentrics—seized control after meticulously planning their coup. Under the cover of street clashes and political assassinations, they infiltrated key ministries, their agents whispering of ancient energies and a destiny beyond mortal rule. Politicians who resisted quietly disappeared, their offices occupied by cold-eyed men in black coats. The press was muzzled, the army brought to heel, and the Reichstag became little more than a temple to their secret doctrine. Outwardly, life in Berlin continued—trains ran on time, factories churned, and ration lines were orderly—but beneath the surface, paranoia festered."
 ger.69.a: "Through Will, Power. Through Power, Destiny."
