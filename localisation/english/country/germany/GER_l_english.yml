 POLITICS_FRIEDRICH_EBERT_DESC: "Born in 1871 in the beautiful town of Heidelberg, Ebert has went a long way. Once his childhood had passed, he migrated north to Bremen and joined the SPD. In the wake of the Chaos that struck Germany after the First World War, Ebert found himself leading the last light of democracy in the country. Will he lead the German Republic to victory, or misery? This remains to be seen."
