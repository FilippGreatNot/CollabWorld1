 deutschlandmain.1.t: "Return to the Capital"
 deutschlandmain.1.d: "Now that we have seized back control of Berlin, we will once again embrace it as our capital now and forever! All of Germany must rejoice, for we are back in our Home!"
 deutschlandmain.1.a: "Welcome to Berlin!"
 
 ger.1.t: "Victory in Berlin"
 ger.1.d: "After months of fighting in Eastern Germany, the frontlines in the civil war against the Spartakusbund have become stale. The last recent Battle, the Battle of Berlin, ended in a Republican victory. The spartacists fought very effectively and we lost a lot of men in the battle, even in the last days. However, now Berlin is fully under the control of our government. Finally we can rest and attempt to fix some internal issues before going on the quest to stabilize Germany and end all the different revolutions across the Fatherland. A Free Germany will arise from the ashes, like a phoenix."
 ger.1.a: "Some Peace At Last"
 ger.2.t: "Disssolving the Reichstag"
 ger.2.d: "Friedrich hates instability. He had hoped that with the victory in Berlin, the situation across the country would calm down and that Germany would be ableto enjoy a bit more internal peace. Instead, the DNVP and Zentrum have seized the opportunity to weaken the SPD and to get new supporters. Now, massive demonstrations are going on across the country and the situation could escalate easily. Friedrich Ebert has been forced to hold a Snap Election, even though it was the last thing he wanted to do. Tommorow, this will be the main news headline across the nation. Who will win? Time will tell. Either way, Ebert stays."
 ger.2.a: "Destiny Approaches"
 ger.3.t: "The Reichstagswahl Begins"
 ger.3.d: "Our snap parliamentary election has begun. People have begun going to the ballot. Some cases of violence have been reported in major cities but generally the election has been generally peaceful. However, there was a major case in Erfurt where the Reichswehr attempted to manipulate the election in favor of the DNVP, revealing a deep-entrenched plot. This just shows that we really need to clean the military and make sure it is loyal to the constitution. Otherwise, they will ultimately become the biggest threat to German democracy and might want to align with the Wehrkommand or the Freikorps if we go to battle with them to reunify the nation. Soon, it will be clear who won. The DNVP... Zentrum... or the SPD... And the winner is..."
 ger.3.a: "The SPD Holds!"
 ger.3.b: "A Christian Democratic Victory"
 ger.3.c: "The DNVP builds a conservative coalition."
