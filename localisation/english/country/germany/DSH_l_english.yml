 ## FOCI ##

 DSH_a_new_era_for_the_bund: "A New Era for the Bund"
 DSH_a_new_era_for_the_bund_desc: "No more shall we hide in the shadows, for once, we have a state to call our own. While we are not the strongest, or the largest, or the most potent force aiming to unify the Vaterland, we certainly do not have the weakest spirits to do so. Morale is one of the most important factors in outlining the success of a war, so why put it to waste? Brothers, Colleagues, arm yourselves, and together, we will defeat this evil!"
 DSH_repurpose_unused_workshops: "Repurpose Unused Workshops"
 DSH_repurpose_unused_workshops_desc: "Southern Baden is not the most industrialised area in Germany, but it certainly IS built up. Due to its proximity to the Rhine, the french border as well as its generally strategic location, it is host to a wide number of peculiar constructions. From ski resorts, to spa towns, to fortifications and to empty wares that we could be using for something else. We will thus convert abandoned complexes at certain areas into factories that will help us bolster our output of firearms."
 DSH_alemannic_infrastructure: "Fill The Potholes"
 DSH_alemannic_infrastructure_desc: "The Great War has not done wonders to this area. And certainly, the civil war we're going through is going to make the problems worse. So, we will put forward funding to fix up the roads around Sudbaden and Wurttemberg and help bolster them with stronger asphalt, hopefully a kind that will be capable of outlasting the war. It will cost us a lot, but it will save a lot more money with the reduced amount of car accidents and other unfortunate events."
 DSH_break_up_worker_revolts: "Break-Up Worker Revolts"
 DSH_break_up_worker_revolts_desc: "One way to defeat a clingy rebellion is to demotivate its membership. And demotivate we will! From funding incentives, to punishing the unwavering, to jailing (and crucially, not killing) its leadership, and sending heaps of propaganda denouncing it and fabricating it's status. Not a lot of effort needs to be put into this for it to work, and, certainly, with our current state of war with the Freikorps, perhaps the revoltees will look the other way and leave."
 DSH_field_new_commanders: "Field New Commanders"
 DSH_field_new_commanders_desc: "Not being the largest political group that has ever formed, we are currently experiencing the brunt of many issues regarding the lack of competent upper staff, not that our current general staff is in any way incompetent, no no, its that there is barely any to begin with. We will begin marketing our needs privately to several key veterans of the war, and hopefully we will enlist some new faces into our ranks."

 DSH_secure_the_support_of_militaristic_industrialists: "Secure The Support Of Militaristic Industrialists"
 DSH_secure_the_support_of_militaristic_industrialists_desc: "The most profitable businesses tend to be involved in widespread manufacture of both weaponry and necessary equipment in order to supply a war, and there are a lot of notable inviduals, not completely outdone by the rampant inflation, that could be willing to sell their arms for us, or to sell us the necessary resources to produce more weapons.

 ## EVENTS ##

 dsh.1.t: "Our organisation converges..."
 dsh.1.d: "We have arrived at a new point of our history, a time where we are no longer bound by overlords but where we are overlords ourselves, and soon, perhaps, we will be the overlords of all of the Vaterland! But its too soon to hope, now we should begin the long and arduous work on securing our grip on power and reconstructing our country."
 dsh.1.a: "What Is The Next Step Of The Operation?"
 dsh.2.t: "Der Stalhelm asks for Assistance!"
 dsh.2.d: "Our brothers-in-arms, and one of our most ingrained allies, have asked us for help in their civil war against the dubious Freikorps. Should we accept? If we give guns to a future enemy, it would be less guns, however, it would be trouble otherwise if the Freikorps win. They wouldn't want to see us supporting an enemy. This is a dilemma that we need to resolve at an instant."
 dsh.2.a: "We would be fools to not recognise our brothers"
 dsh.2.b: "We don't support rival paramilitaries..."
 dsh.3.t: "The Wehrkommando Accepts!"
 dsh.3.d: "The negotiations with the Wehrkommando has led to a resolution, granting us necessary guns and experience needed to win the civil war. We are very thankful for this and hope that this is a sign that the Wehrkommando would be willing to reunify with us in the future, peacefully."
 dsh.3.a: "Less strain for our factories"
 dsh.4.t: "The Wehrkommando Declines!"
 dsh.4.d: "Years of relations, days of requesting, and only a minute that has taken us to understand the position we have found ourselves in. Our path is not set in brotherhood, but in treachery. As the Wehrkommando delivered their response to our plea, it was clear from the moment we read the first sentence. They are no brothers of ours, they are traitors to our cause, a devil at war, a cog of the gearwork of the war. And Yet, they are the ones behind it, they are behind the collapse. Their weak incompetence has not only lost us the Great War, but it will lose us this war too."
 dsh.4.a: "Let them rot."
 dsh.5.t: "The New Man In Charge"
 dsh.5.d: "We have done it, we have defeated the Freikorps, but many questions still lie; What is our next path? How should we approach the exiled monarchs? And most importantly of all, who should our next Governor be? After all, Seldte is growing a bit old for the job, and Duesterberg's faction seems to grow ever potent."
 dsh.5.a: "Save ourselves the trouble and appoint Duesterberg"
 dsh.5.b: "We will look to the past and appoint a Regency for our future King!"
 dsh.6.t: "This half-year's Investments"
 dsh.6.d: "It is the time for us to invest into our industrialisation scheme, from a selection of three distinct options. Either we invest into our civilian industry, or increase our army's budget, or we instead attempt to improve our roads, or we can cancel the scheme altogether, which option should we choose?"
 dsh.6.a: "We shall invest into the scheme"
 dsh.6.b: "We will not be investing this time"
 dsh.6.c: "Stop giving me these events please!"
 dsh.7.t: "A Throne In Need Of A King"
 dsh.7.d: "The Question of the monarchy of our nation is held, at high praise by our supporters, and many are yearning on what monarch we shall choose. Some are arguing that we should look towards instating a local monarch, one that knows our local cultures and customs, while others propose that we select members from the Hohenzollerns and beyond. What will the council choose?"
 dsh.7.a: "The King of Württemberg will take our vote!"
 dsh.7.b: "He is too inexperienced of a monarch to be fit for governing"
 dsh.8.t: "Baden contests over leadership"
 dsh.8.d: "The Grand Duke of Baden, Friedrich II, has asked us to accept his position as the ruling sovereign over our territory, his arguments come from the fact that our support is strongest in his lands and that he may be able to serve the people better with his experience, should the old grand duke be accepted?"
 dsh.8.a: "Welcome Home!"
 dsh.8.b: "Look at him, he's about to turn into dust, No!"
 dsh.9.t: "The Council proposes solution involving Co-rule"
 dsh.9.d: "The amount of conflicts these two generate cannot be understated. If we pick the Swabian, the alemannes will be furious, and the reverse is true too. Besides a number of issues, our Council has proposed a quick solution to resolve this debate, and the answer is simple; Co-rule. The King will have a higher status, that much is true, but he will yield an equal amount of power over the Grand Duke, all while being under the supervision of a meditary council to settle debates and the like."
 dsh.9.a: "Enough for them to shut up"
 dsh.9.b: "We need a third candidate so that nobody will be happy."
 dsh.10.t: "The Mad Monarchist?"
 dsh.10.d: "Nobody expected him, nobody wanted him, but alas, he is here, standing as a potential candidate for the potential crown of Germany. Should we let a Hohenzollern rule over us? Several has asked, but this is in ignorance to the fact that we own the territories of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen itself, and thus it is not as bizarre as it may seem. He, with his enthusiasm and nationalism, would bring an entirely new view of Germany"
 dsh.10.a: "He is our King! Long Live King August I!"
 dsh.11.t: "The Expeditions have returned"
 dsh.11.a: "Let us reap the fruits of our labour"
 dsh.12.t: "Der Stahlhelm demands our immediate annexation!"
 dsh.13.t: "Der Stahlhelm offers peaceful reunification"
 dsh.14.t: "Who wants Strudel?"
 dsh.14.a: "Give me a slice!"
 dsh.15.t: "Unification of the West"
 dsh.15.a: "Another Stahlhelm Banger"
 dsh.16.t: "A Patriot's Vow"
 dsh.16.d: "It is not a promise only to the Vaterland, but to thyself. Germany must be whole, it must be one, and it must be ours. We must do everything we can to achieve this, no matter the cost and no matter the pain. We have been born in a single Germany and we will die in a single Germany, whatever the circumstance may be."
 dsh.16.a: "Germany must be one and whole, no exceptions"
 dsh.17.t: "Der Stahlhelm offers us peaceful integration!"
 dsh.17.a: "It's better than the alternative"
 dsh.17.b: "Let them try to gain a single grain of sand!"
 dsh.18_t: "Der Stahlhelm unifies Germany!"
 dsh.18.d: "In the turbulent years following the Treaty of Versailles, German Society teeters on the brink of collapse. Humiliated by defeat in the Great War, burdened by crippling reparations, and fractured by political extremism, Germany is a nation in chaos. Amid this turmoil, Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten—the League of Frontline Soldiers—emerges as a powerful force of reactionary nationalism, determined to restore Germany’s honor and reunify the fractured Reich. Der Stahlhelm’s ranks swell with disenchanted veterans, unemployed workers, and nationalist youths, all united by a shared disdain for the Weimar Republic and a burning desire to avenge Germany’s humiliation. Their black-and-silver insignia, emblazoned with the motto 'Frontsoldaten, vereinigt euch!' (Frontline Soldiers, Unite!), becomes a symbol of resistance and hope for millions. With clandestine support from conservative industrialists, monarchists, and elements within the Reichswehr, Der Stahlhelm begins to consolidate its power."
 dsh.18_a: "The Iron Resurgence"
 dsh.19.t: "Assassination of Crown Prince Wilhelm"
 dsh.19.d: "Suspense is felt throughout the royal hall, as the Crown Prince, once presumed to be one of the most powerful figures in all of Germany, has collapsed under mysterious circumstances. Reports state that traces of poison have been found near his lips, and that there were possible signs of foul play. Emergency services arrived to find the monarch long dead, pale and stiff. The Killer is yet to be found, but it is under everyone's assumption that the cause is not too far away from the imperial heartland."
 dsh.19.a: "Wouldn't be a civil war without some political assassinations..."
 dsh.20.t: "Deciding the extent of our claims"
 dsh.20.d: "Germany's history among the low countries straddles across all kinds of Belgian and Dutch provinces, from Cambrai and Hainaut in the HRE, to the Prussian plans for the division of Belgium and taking the east for their own. It is an interesting place at an interesting time, and we are the ones interested in it! We'll have to decide one of two ways as to which we can approach this matter, be it severe, and demand historically German or border territories planned to be annexed after a possible Great War victory, to a more timid plan, to simply recapture the Eupen-Malmedy strip."
 dsh.20.a: "Let's exploit Belgium's weakness and vulnerability"
 dsh.20.b: "Let's be sensible and only claim something they'd likely accept."
 dsh.21.t: "The Germans Demand Northern Schleswig!"
 dsh.22.t: "The Germans Demand an Anschluss!"
 dsh.23.t: "The Germans Demand we concede the East!"
 dsh.24.t: "The Germans Demand we concede Eupen!"
 dsh.25.t: "The Germans Demand our immediate Annexation!"
 dsh.26.t: "Death of Frederick II of Baden"
 dsh.26.a: "Sad to see him go"
 dsh.27.t: "Choosing our Monarch"
 dsh.27.a: "Albrecht of Wurttemberg"
 dsh.27.b: "Friedrich II of Baden"
 dsh.28.t: "The Successor of Friedrich the II"
