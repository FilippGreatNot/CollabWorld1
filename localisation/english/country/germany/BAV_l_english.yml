 ### Ideas ###
 
 BAV_high_conservative_opposition: "High Conservative Opposition"
 BAV_high_conservative_opposition_desc: "The brutal tyranny of the Jacobin regime of Eugene Levine has led to a massive conservative upheaval and new support for a potential restauration of the Monarchy of the Wittelsbach. The opposition is also made up of many BVP politicians and agents from Stuttgart, all of which seek to end socialism in Bavaria. We must get rid of this rebellious band."
 BAV_extremely_disorganized_army: "Extremely Disorganized Army"
 BAV_extremely_disorganized_army_desc: "We don't have a proper force to defend ourselves. The only reason we survived the early stages of the German Civil War is the preoccupation of the Freikorps with the Spartakusbund. Now, we truly do need to restructure our army and increase our military spending. If we don't do so, marching into München will be a piece of a cake for the more advanced Freikorps militants."
 BAV_very_disorganized_army: "Very Disorganized Army"
 BAV_the_effects_of_the_economic_crisis: "The Effects of the Economic Crisis"
 BAV_the_effects_of_the_economic_crisis_desc: "One of the regions that was hit the hardest by the war was Bavaria. Often, the central government didn't care about us and we remained deindustrialized and this has had terrible consequences for us. On top of that, as if things weren't bad enough, the economic policies of our socialist republic haven't even been a bit succesful, instead they have even been counterproductive and have caused more suffering for the average Bayer."
 
 ### Decisions ###
 
 BAV_brewing_counterrevolution: "Brewing Counterrevolution..."
 BAV_red_terror: "The Red Terror"
 BAV_red_terror_desc: "The radical Jacobite policies of the Levine Government have led to a massive conservative upheveal. In return, Eugene has instead commenced a campaign of terror and fear against all counter-revolutionaries labeled by foreign experts as the Red Terror. If this brutal way of suppresing conservative or even monarchist sentiments doesn't suceed, Bavaria will undoubtely fall back into the hands of the reactionaries."

 ### Events ###

 bavaria.1.t: "The BNBAP Marches on Regensburg"
 bavaria.1.d: "The party of Joseph Goebbels, the Bavarian National Bolshevik Worker's Party, has decided to use its opportunity in the political crisis Bavaria is facing and march on our government in Regensburg with thousands of men. Now, it is on us to decide if Bavaria will fall to this crazy lunatic. We can either cower in fear and let him march into Regensburg and take control of the government, or we can squash his little coup before he is able to do any damage to Bavaria."
 bavaria.1.a: "Goebbels Captures Regensburg"
 bavaria.1.b: "Stop this Lunatic's Coup Now!"
 bavaria.3.t: "The Freikorps offer us Subjugation"
 bavaria.3.d: "The newly-established 'Government of National Salvation' in Stuttgart, or, as we'd like to still call them, the freikorps, have approached our diplomats to offer a peaceful solution to the question of our independence; We agree and we pass control to local authorities favorable to their regime, if we refuse, well, we will declare war..."
 bavaria.3.a: "We work for the good of the People"
 bavaria.3.b: "We will not let these rose-painted reactionaries acquire our territories without a fight!"
 bavaria.4.t: "Joseph Goebbels Reunites the German Nation!"
 bavaria.4.d: "Surprising news have come from Berlin. The leader of the National Bolshevik Party of Bavaria, Joseph Goebbels, has succesfuly reunited Germany back into one single state. He has proclaimed it a national bolshevik one, promising a new and glorious future for the German Nation under communism and nationalism. The Soviet Union and the French watch with worry, as Goebbels has been critical of both. Many would say he is a mix between the two, and that's what they are afraid of. This resurgent Germany could definitely become a threat to European peace."
 bavaria.4.a: "A National Bolshevik Germany?"
 bavaria.5.t: "Bavarian Restauration"
 bavaria.5.d: "Our regime has collapsed and the conservative factions in our country have taken control and re-established the monarchy. It is time to build a good, new and overall strong conservative and national Bayern. The regime of the bolsheviks has been brutal, but now it is time for change and a return to peace and normality."
 bavaria.5.a: "BAYERN ÜBER ALLES!"
 bavaria.6.t: "The Bavarian Soviet Republic"
 bavaria.6.d: "In 1922, the Bavarian Soviet Republic stands as a testament to revolutionary resilience. Born from the chaos of post-World War I Germany, it initially emerged in April 1919, when radical socialists and communists seized control of Munich in response to the collapse of the German Empire. Its survival against overwhelming odds can be attributed to a combination of strategic alliances with left-wing movements, increased support from the Soviet Union, and a reinvigorated, disciplined militia. By 1922, the Bavarian Soviet Republic has managed to solidify its power, enacting sweeping socialist reforms, nationalizing industry, and organizing a planned economy to rally the working class and peasantry to its cause. Despite all of this, our economy still suffers massively and our policies have in some ways even made the situation worse. The existence of our state remains precarious, as it continues to face relentless opposition from the Freikorps, which views it as a threat to the stability of Germany. Despite the ongoing civil conflict, the Bavarian Soviet Republic persists, emboldened by its commitment to revolutionary ideals and its desire to inspire a broader socialist movement in Europe. The balance of power in Germany hangs in the balance as the Bavarian state seeks to not only survive but spark a wider left-wing uprising."
 bavaria.6.a: "Socialism in Bavaria must endure."
 BAV_thanks_for_playing_tt: "§RThank you for playing as Bavaria!§!"
 bavaria.7.t: "The Bavarian Communist Party"
 bavaria.7.d: "In 1921, due to the ideological differences of the KPD in the north and the fraction in the south, we split off from the KPD and established the BKP, the Bavarian Communist Party. This was seen as a move of betreyal by the spartacists and since then they've cut of all ties. Now we are left alone, and have to bring the true revolution to Germany on our own. Maybe one day, we will be able to reunite with the spartacists and establish a unified communist party again. But until then, we are enemies and not brothers. What can one do, when they view us as traitors to the revolution?"
 bavaria.7.a: "Arbeiter der Welt, vereinigt euch!"
 bavaria.8.t: "The Bavarian Anarcho-Pacifists"
 bavaria.8.d: "Before the Jacobins of Levine seized control, the anarcho-pacifists used to hold partial control in the council republic. Their leader has been Gustav Landauer, an anarchist theorist and revolutionary. He continues to radically oppose the Jacobin regime, which he views as terrorist and Counter-Revolutionary. Right now, he is hiding from the red terror and would be ready to seize an opportunity with his supporters and try to overthrow the tyrannical regime. All the people of Bavaria and Germany in general are sick of war. If Landauer were to establish anarcho-pacifism, it is likely he would gain a lot of support. After all, he wishes what the people wish: and that is Peace."
 bavaria.8.a: "Mother Anarchy Loves Her Sons"
 bavaria.9.t: "The Bavarian USPD"
 bavaria.9.d: "Kurt Eisner was the one who declared this republic, and he was the leader of the Bavarian USPD. However, he was assasinated by a degenerate nationalist and now Ernst Toller continues to lead the USPD. We lost control of the government after Eugene Levine and the Jacobins took charge, but perhaps an opportunity will present itself soon to launch a rebellion and end the Red Terror once and for all. If we are able to do this, we can finally set Bavaria on the right path and make sure the people are free from the tyranny that Levine and his supporters have been imposing on the Bavarian people. Maybe one day, we will be able to unite Germany peacefully with the SPD and establish a unified socialist front. There is a lot of work to be done."
 bavaria.9.a: "We remember you, Kurt Eisner"
 bavaria.10.t: "Formation of the BNBAP"
 bavaria.10.d: "Disturbing news have come from München today. The nationalist speaker Joseph Goebbels has formed his own opposition to the Eugene Levine government, a party called the Bavarian National Bolshevik Workers Party. Goebbels promotes an even more radical change in society akin to the October Revolution, but he is also a big Anti-Semite and has labelled our chairman Eugene as a dirty jew capitalist traitor and tyrant. He is finding support in many bars across Munich and now his supporters are commiting acts of violence against members of the BKP. This is a grave crisis for the Soviet Republic."
 bavaria.10.a: "What a madman!"
 BAV_goebbels_threat_tt: "§RIf we don't keep this movement under control, Eugene's head might end up on a stick§!"
 bavaria.11.t: "Assasination Attempt on Levine"
 bavaria.11.d: "Levine was making a speech against the reactionaries in Stuttgart at the main square in Munich, and a Goebbels-sponsored assasin came to the speech and took out a gun. He shot Levine in the chest. Eugene was rushed to the hospital and now doctors are trying to save his life with all they can, but the chairman's future is uncertain. We wait with open eyes and ears."
 bavaria.11.a: "The Chairman Lives!"
 bavaria.11.b: "Levine dies, the BKP moderates take charge."
 BAV_max_levien_tt: "§RMax Levien and the BKP moderates will take charge!§!
 bavaria.12.t: "An Opportunity Rises"
 bavaria.12.d: "The events of the last few weeks have caused chaos on the streets and soldiers are even mutineering. We now have the perfect opportunity to return the old government of the USPD or the Anarchopacifists. Together, we can plan a coup against the BKP and take charge once again and end the Red Terror. Should we risk it and attempt a coup? Is it time to overthrow the BKP?"
 bavaria.12.a: "Plan an Overthrow"
 bavaria.12.b: "Thrawt the USPD Coup Attempts"
 bavaria.13.t: "The BKP Overthrown"
 bavaria.13.d: "We have succesfuly taken control of Regensburg and exiled the high leadership of the BKP. Now, it is finally time to choose who will actually lead as chairman. We can choose Ernst Toller and the USPD, or we can choose Gustav Landauer and the Anarcho-Pacifists. The future is uncertain, but now we have to make a choice of leadership"
 bavaria.13.a: "The USPD Takes Charge"
 bavaria.13.b: "The Anarcho-Pacifists secure victory"
 bavaria.14.t: "A New Day in Regensburg"
 bavaria.14.d: "The instability of the last few weeks and months has finally ended. Bavaria's future has been chosen, and now we have to face foreign threats and rebuild Bavaria so that we can survive. The Freikorps stands at our door, and they seek to destroy us. We must ready up for a potential war, and let's be fully honest: it's coming. For now, let's celebrate the return of stability."
 bavaria.14.a: "The Future of Bavaria has been sealed!"
