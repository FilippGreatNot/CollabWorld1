 BAV_high_conservative_opposition_desc: "The brutal tyranny of the Jacobin regime of Eugene Levine has led to a massive conservative upheaval and new support for a potential restoration of the Monarchy via the reintroduction of the House of Wittelsbach.

 BAV_extremely_disorganized_army: "Extremely Disorganized Army"
 BAV_extremely_disorganized_army_desc: "We don't have a proper force to defend ourselves. The only reason we survived the early stages of the German Civil War is the preoccupation of the Freikorps with the Spartakusbund.

 BAV_the_effects_of_the_economic_crisis_desc: "One of the regions that was hit the hardest by the war was Bavaria. Often, the central government didn't care about us and we remained deindustrialized and this has had terrible consequences for us. On top of that, as if things weren't bad enough, the economic policies of our socialist republic haven't even been a bit succesful, instead they have even been counterproductive and have caused more suffering for the average Bayer."

In return, Eugene has instead commenced a campaign of terror and fear against all counter-revolutionaries labeled by foreign experts as the Red Terror.

 ### Events ###

 bavaria.1.t: "The BNBAP Marches on Regensburg"
 bavaria.1.d: "The party of Joseph Goebbels, the Bavarian National Bolshevik Worker's Party, has decided to use its opportunity in the political crisis Bavaria is facing and march on our government in Regensburg with thousands of men. Now, it is on us to decide if Bavaria will fall to this crazy lunatic. We can either cower in fear and let him march into Regensburg and take control of the government, or we can squash his little coup before he is able to do any damage to Bavaria."
 bavaria.1.a: "Goebbels Captures Regensburg"
 bavaria.1.b: "Stop this Lunatic's Coup Now!"
 bavaria.3.t: "The Freikorps offer us Subjugation"
 bavaria.3.d: "The newly-established 'Government of National Salvation' in Stuttgart, or, as we'd like to still call them, the freikorps, have approached our diplomats to offer a peaceful solution to the question of our independence; We agree and we pass control to local authorities favorable to their regime, if we refuse, well, we will declare war..."
 bavaria.3.a: "We work for the good of the People"
 bavaria.3.b: "We will not let these rose-painted reactionaries acquire our territories without a fight!"
 bavaria.4.t: "Joseph Goebbels Reunites the German Nation!"
 bavaria.4.d: "Surprising news have come from Berlin. The leader of the National Bolshevik Party of Bavaria, Joseph Goebbels, has succesfuly reunited Germany back into one single state. He has proclaimed it a national bolshevik one, promising a new and glorious future for the German Nation under communism and nationalism. The Soviet Union and the French watch with worry, as Goebbels has been critical of both. Many would say he is a mix between the two, and that's what they are afraid of. This resurgent Germany could definitely become a threat to European peace."
 bavaria.4.a: "A National Bolshevik Germany?"
 bavaria.5.t: "Bavarian Restoration"
 bavaria.5.d: "Our regime has collapsed and the conservative factions in our country have taken control and re-established the monarchy. It is time to build a good, new and overall strong conservative and national Bayern. The regime of the bolsheviks has been brutal, but now it is time for change and a return to peace and normality."
 bavaria.5.a: "BAYERN ÜBER ALLES!"
 bavaria.6.t: "The Bavarian Soviet Republic"
 bavaria.6.d: "In 1922, the Bavarian Soviet Republic stands as a testament to revolutionary resilience. Born from the chaos of post-World War I Germany, it initially emerged in April 1919, when radical socialists and communists seized control of Munich in response to the collapse of the German Empire. Its survival against overwhelming odds can be attributed to a combination of strategic alliances with left-wing movements, increased support from the Soviet Union, and a reinvigorated, disciplined militia. By 1922, the Bavarian Soviet Republic has managed to solidify its power, enacting sweeping socialist reforms, nationalizing industry, and organizing a planned economy to rally the working class and peasantry to its cause. Despite all of this, our economy still suffers massively and our policies have in some ways even made the situation worse. The existence of our state remains precarious, as it continues to face relentless opposition from the Freikorps, which views it as a threat to the stability of Germany. Despite the ongoing civil conflict, the Bavarian Soviet Republic persists, emboldened by its commitment to revolutionary ideals and its desire to inspire a broader socialist movement in Europe. The balance of power in Germany hangs in the balance as the Bavarian state seeks to not only survive but spark a wider left-wing uprising."
 bavaria.6.a: "Socialism in Bavaria must endure."
 BAV_thanks_for_playing_tt: "§RThank you for playing as Bavaria!§!"
 bavaria.7.t: "The Bavarian Communist Party"
 bavaria.7.d: "In 1921, due to the ideological differences of the KPD in the north and the fraction in the south, we split off from the KPD and established the BKP, the Bavarian Communist Party. This was seen as a move of betreyal by the spartacists and since then they've cut of all ties. Now we are left alone, and have to bring the true revolution to Germany on our own. Maybe one day, we will be able to reunite with the spartacists and establish a unified communist party again. But until then, we are enemies and not brothers. What can one do, when they view us as traitors to the revolution?"
 bavaria.7.a: "Arbeiter der Welt, vereinigt euch!"
 bavaria.8.t: "The Bavarian Anarcho-Pacifists"
 bavaria.8.d: "Before the Jacobins of Levine seized control, the anarcho-pacifists used to hold partial control in the council republic. Their leader has been Gustav Landauer, an anarchist theorist and revolutionary. He continues to radically oppose the Jacobin regime, which he views as terrorist and Counter-Revolutionary. Right now, he is hiding from the red terror and would be ready to seize an opportunity with his supporters and try to overthrow the tyrannical regime. All the people of Bavaria and Germany in general are sick of war. If Landauer were to establish anarcho-pacifism, it is likely he would gain a lot of support. After all, he wishes what the people wish: and that is Peace."
 bavaria.8.a: "Mother Anarchy Loves Her Sons"
 bavaria.9.t: "The Bavarian USPD"
 bavaria.9.d: "Kurt Eisner was the one who declared this republic, and he was the leader of the Bavarian USPD. However, he was assasinated by a degenerate nationalist and now Ernst Toller continues to lead the USPD. We lost control of the government after Eugene Levine and the Jacobins took charge, but perhaps an opportunity will present itself soon to launch a rebellion and end the Red Terror once and for all. If we are able to do this, we can finally set Bavaria on the right path and make sure the people are free from the tyranny that Levine and his supporters have been imposing on the Bavarian people. Maybe one day, we will be able to unite Germany peacefully with the SPD and establish a unified socialist front. There is a lot of work to be done."
 bavaria.9.a: "We remember you, Kurt Eisner"
 bavaria.10.t: "Formation of the BNBAP"
 bavaria.10.d: "Disturbing news have come from München today. The nationalist speaker Joseph Goebbels has formed his own opposition to the Eugene Levine government, a party called the Bavarian National Bolshevik Workers Party. Goebbels promotes an even more radical change in society akin to the October Revolution, but he is also a big Anti-Semite and has labelled our chairman Eugene as a dirty jew capitalist traitor and tyrant. He is finding support in many bars across Munich and now his supporters are commiting acts of violence against members of the BKP. This is a grave crisis for the Soviet Republic."
 bavaria.10.a: "What a madman!"
 BAV_goebbels_threat_tt: "§RIf we don't keep this movement under control, Eugene's head might end up on a stick§!"
 bavaria.11.t: "Assasination Attempt on Levine"
 bavaria.11.d: "Levine was making a speech against the reactionaries in Stuttgart at the main square in Munich, and a Goebbels-sponsored assasin came to the speech and took out a gun. He shot Levine in the chest. Eugene was rushed to the hospital and now doctors are trying to save his life with all they can, but the chairman's future is uncertain. We wait with open eyes and ears."
 bavaria.11.a: "The Chairman Lives!"
 bavaria.11.b: "Levine dies, the BKP moderates take charge."
 BAV_max_levien_tt: "§RMax Levien and the BKP moderates will take charge!§!
 bavaria.12.t: "An Opportunity Rises"
 bavaria.12.d: "The events of the last few weeks have caused chaos on the streets and soldiers are even mutineering. We now have the perfect opportunity to return the old government of the USPD or the Anarchopacifists. Together, we can plan a coup against the BKP and take charge once again and end the Red Terror. Should we risk it and attempt a coup? Is it time to overthrow the BKP?"
 bavaria.12.a: "Plan an Overthrow"
 bavaria.12.b: "Thrawt the USPD Coup Attempts"
 bavaria.13.t: "The BKP Overthrown"
 bavaria.13.d: "We have succesfuly taken control of Regensburg and exiled the high leadership of the BKP. Now, it is finally time to choose who will actually lead as chairman. We can choose Ernst Toller and the USPD, or we can choose Gustav Landauer and the Anarcho-Pacifists. The future is uncertain, but now we have to make a choice of leadership"
 bavaria.13.a: "The USPD Takes Charge"
 bavaria.13.b: "The Anarcho-Pacifists secure victory"
 bavaria.14.t: "A New Day in Regensburg"
 bavaria.14.d: "The instability of the last few weeks and months has finally ended. Bavaria's future has been chosen, and now we have to face foreign threats and rebuild Bavaria so that we can survive. The Freikorps stands at our door, and they seek to destroy us. We must ready up for a potential war, and let's be fully honest: it's coming. For now, let's celebrate the return of stability."
 bavaria.14.a: "The Future of Bavaria has been sealed!"
 bavaria.15.t: "Jacobin Backlash"
 bavaria.15.d: "The jacobins did't ignore our moves to rid them of their influences. They have openly criticized the Chairman Max Levien, which has highly affected the party's stability and made our government completely incapable for about a week. This just shows what we were worrying about, these people are wildcards. They shouldn't have a long future in the new socialist Bavaria."
 bavaria.15.a: "One day we will get rid of them."
 bavaria.16.t: "Bavaria Seeks to Repair Relations"
 bavaria.16.d: "After the death of the Jacobin Tyrant Levine, the new leadership of the Bavarian BKP has contacted us and stated their wish to repair relations and discuss a potential reunification of the KPD. This is a great opportunity for us. Now we possibly have one less threat to worry about. These are good news for the future of Germany. Bavaria, we forgive you."
 bavaria.16.a: "Brothers again, perhaps?"
 bavaria.17.t: "The Legacy of the Wittelsbachs"
 bavaria.17.d: "For centuries, the Wittelsbach family ruled the Kingdom of Bavaria. With the Soviet Republic established, we inevitably couldn't let them continue ruling the country. After all, the ideals of the revolution are based on getting rid of such tyrants. However, many people do view at the old times with nostalgia, especially the grandfathers who lived to see the time before the rise of the Kaiserreich. Sometimes, one wonders: what if all of this didn't happen? What if Bavaria had stayed independent, and the Prussians never took the domination of Germany? Maybe things would be better? Well, anyway. They are reactionaries in the end. The Wittelsbach will be remembered for who they were."
 bavaria.17.a: "Tschüss, Königsfamilie!"
 bavaria.18.t: "Drafting an Economic Plan"
 bavaria.18.d: "We need to decide which sector of the economy we should focus on in our goal of rebuilding Bavaria. Firstly, we could attempt to generally make the economy more effective and fight corruption to make building more effective. Then, we could also attempt to heavily industrialize the civilian sector. Another option would be to focus on the military industry in order to be able to protect the Revolution from outside threats such as the Freikorps. The choice is ours to make."
 bavaria.18.a: "Focus on Efficiency"
 bavaria.18.b: "Focus on Civilian Industrialization"
 bavaria.18.c: "Focus on Military Industrialization"
 bavaria.19.t: "Max Levien Unites Germany"
 bavaria.19.d: "Germany has just been united through military force by the Bavarian Revolutionary Max Levien. Levien took charge of the Bavarian Soviet Republic after the Jacobin Dictator Levine was assasinated by a nationalist assasin. Since then, he has built a strong military force and industrialized Bavaria, succesfuly defending it from Freikorps forces and taking Stuttgart. Then, he united the Communist Party under Southern leadership and made sure all of Germany submits to the revolution. Germany's future is red."
 bavaria.19.a: "The New Marx?"

 BAV_continue_the_red_terror_desc: "The crisis is not over yet. We must continue to supress all reactionary sentiment and make sure that our rule continues.

 BAV_arrest_freikorps_agents_desc: "Many agents from the Freikorps are running in the streets and assasinating our leaders wherever they can, as they have done with Kurt Eisner and many others. We must arrest all of them and sentence them to the guillotine. They are reactionary degenerates."
 BAV_force_the_militias_into_obedience: "Force the Militias Into Obedience"
 BAV_force_the_militias_into_obedience_desc: "If the Freikorpler in Stuttgart were to come marching to us, we wouldn't be able to defend ourselves whatsoever. It is our duty to reorganize the army and establish a proper chain of command in order to be able to defend the Bavarian Revolution."
 BAV_stop_the_bavarian_hyperinflation: "Stop the Bavarian Hyperinflation"
 BAV_stop_the_bavarian_hyperinflation_desc: "In order to stop the economic crisis, firstly we must get rid of or minimize the inflation plagueing the country, especially the cities.

 BAV_victory_of_bkp_m_desc: "With the crisis finally over and the old controversial chairman Eugene Levine in his grave, we have succesfuly put the Jacobin wing of the BKP under severe pressure. This is a great thing, as now we can end what our opposition calls the red terror and implement true socialist reforms in order to help the people, which the old regime didn't do. It's time for change. Our goal however, remains the same. The Revolution in Bavaria and in all of Germany must be victorious. Perhaps, an improvement in relations with the Spartakusbund would be a good move to do so."
 BAV_weaken_the_jacobin_wing_of_the_party: "Weaken the Jacobin Wing of the BKP"
 BAV_weaken_the_jacobin_wing_of_the_party_desc: "The jacobins are at fault for the many failed reforms of our state and they have terrorized the Bavarian people severely for the last 2 and a half years. It is time that we weaken their grip on the structure of the party. The party must be led by real communists like Max Levien who seeks to benefit the people, and are not sick in the mind like the Jacobins. Internally, Bavaria is generally safe from instability. The red terror which the jacobins promote must finally come to an end. We will purge the Jacobins from higher positions in the Bavarian Communist Party."

 BAV_repair_relationships_with_the_spartakusbund_desc: "The revolution in Germany is evidently under threat. To our west, the Freikorps is months away from launching a brutal attack into our territory. Meanwhile, the Poles in Silesia and the Republic encircle the Spartacists in the north. If they suceed, the revolution will be over. We need to stand united. Our grudges over policymaking or leadership must be put aside for now.

 BAV_exile_further_wittelsbach_family_members_desc: "While we did kick out a ton of monarchists and Wittelsbach royals out of Bavaria when the revolution began, a few remained. In the last few months, we have seen what the conservative opposition was capable of. As we lower restrictions, we need to make sure that the opposition does not show up again. Therefore, it is neccesary that we exile all potential collaborators to the reactionaries to one of the neighboring countries. This will make it harder for a potential Freikorps occupation to suceed."
 BAV_stir_revolutionary_sentiment: "Stir Revolutionary Sentiment"
 BAV_stir_revolutionary_sentiment_desc: "If one takes a careful look at the people of Bayern, it is quite noticeable they aren't as excited about the prospects of the revolution as we are. They are more focused on the peace element. We must make sure that they realize that true peace will only come from making sure the reactionaries never see daylight.

 BAV_a_true_marxist_economic_model_desc: "In order to achieve true communism, we must carefully follow the Manifesto and organize the production lines of the republic accordingly.

 BAV_hunt_down_the_anarcho_pacifists_desc: "In many parts of our society, we have secret anarcho-pacifist allegiants led by none other than the degenerate Gustav Landauer. While the Red Terror should not be repeated, it is neccessary to hunt down this scum. If we were to find ourselves in a desperate situation, these idiots would be to first to surrender to the reactionaries.

 BAV_following_the_footsteps_of_karl_marx_desc: "It is apparent that the BKP is the true succesor of the old KPD and the succesor to Karl Marx himself.

 BAV_seek_soviet_financial_support: "Seek Soviet Financial Support"
 BAV_seek_soviet_financial_support_desc: "We are simply missing the money neccesary to facilitate Bavaria's economic growth. Because of this, we must try to ask Soviets to give us some cash. This will help them spread their influence and make more of Germany red, while we will be able to deal with our economic problems more easily. Overall, it's a win-win situation for both sides. We will send a delegation to Moscow tommorow."
 BAV_modernize_the_bavarian_countryside: "Modernize the Bavarian Countryside"
 BAV_modernize_the_bavarian_countryside_desc: "Our countryside has become very rural once again and its roads new to be brought to date.

 BAV_recycle_consumer_goods: "Recycle Consumer Goods for Resources"
 BAV_recycle_consumer_goods_desc: "Bavaria lacks the resources that are neccesary for the production of weapons, the only one we have being the aluminium production in the Bavarian forests.

 BAV_strenghten_the_ministry_of_education_desc: "In order to improve our technological and economical capabilities, we must strenghten our education system so that it can produce good and skilled workers to build the country back up from the ruins.

 BAV_provide_jobs_for_the_workers: "Provide Jobs for the Workers"
 BAV_provide_jobs_for_the_workers_desc: "One of the key elements of the Bavarian economic crisis is the widespread unemployment, especially in cities.

 BAV_continue_the_jacobin_plan_desc: "Our current radical reforms of the economy just haven't had enough to show their fruits.

 BAV_rapid_weapons_production: "Rapid Weapons Production"
 BAV_rapid_weapons_production_desc: "In order to properly prepare for the upcoming war, we need to quickly militarize and establish a production of guns and artillery. Due to our missing industry, the Freikorps is far more superior in the terms of logistics, supply and equipment.
