 ### Ideas ###
 
 BAV_high_conservative_opposition: "High Conservative Opposition"
 BAV_high_conservative_opposition_desc: "The brutal tyranny of the Jacobin regime of Eugene Levine has led to a massive conservative upheaval and new support for a potential restauration of the Monarchy of the Wittelsbach. The opposition is also made up of many BVP politicians and agents from Stuttgart, all of which seek to end socialism in Bavaria. We must get rid of this rebellious band."
 BAV_extremely_disorganized_army: "Extremely Disorganized Army"
 BAV_extremely_disorganized_army_desc: "We don't have a proper force to defend ourselves. The only reason we survived the early stages of the German Civil War is the preoccupation of the Freikorps with the Spartakusbund. Now, we truly do need to restructure our army and increase our military spending. If we don't do so, marching into München will be a piece of a cake for the more advanced Freikorps militants."
 BAV_the_effects_of_the_economic_crisis: "The Effects of the Economic Crisis"
 BAV_the_effects_of_the_economic_crisis_desc: "One of the regions that was hit the hardest by the war was Bavaria. Often, the central government didn't care about us and we remained deindustrialized and this has had terrible consequences for us. On top of that, as if things weren't bad enough, the economic policies of our socialist republic haven't even been a bit succesful, instead they have even been counterproductive and have caused more suffering for the average Bayer."

In return, Eugene has instead commenced a campaign of terror and fear against all counter-revolutionaries labeled by foreign experts as the Red Terror. If this brutal way of suppresing conservative or even monarchist sentiments doesn't suceed, Bavaria will undoubtely fall back into the hands of the reactionaries."

 bavaria.1.d: "The party of Joseph Goebbels, the Bavarian National Bolshevik Worker's Party, has decided to use its opportunity in the political crisis Bavaria is facing and march on our government in Regensburg with thousands of men. Now, it is on us to decide if Bavaria will fall to this crazy lunatic. We can either cower in fear and let him march into Regensburg and take control of the government, or we can squash his little coup before he is able to do any damage to Bavaria."
 bavaria.1.a: "Goebbels Captures Regensburg"
 bavaria.1.b: "Stop this Lunatic's Coup Now!"
 bavaria.3.t: "The Freikorps offer us Subjugation"
 bavaria.3.d: "The newly-established 'Government of National Salvation' in Stuttgart, or, as we'd like to still call them, the freikorps, have approached our diplomats to offer a peaceful solution to the question of our independence; We agree and we pass control to local authorities favorable to their regime, if we refuse, well, we will declare war..."

 bavaria.3.b: "We will not let these rose-painted reactionaries acquire our territories without a fight!"
 bavaria.4.t: "Joseph Goebbels Reunites the German Nation!"
 bavaria.4.d: "Surprising news have come from Berlin. The leader of the National Bolshevik Party of Bavaria, Joseph Goebbels, has succesfuly reunited Germany back into one single state. He has proclaimed it a national bolshevik one, promising a new and glorious future for the German Nation under communism and nationalism. The Soviet Union and the French watch with worry, as Goebbels has been critical of both. Many would say he is a mix between the two, and that's what they are afraid of. This resurgent Germany could definitely become a threat to European peace."
 bavaria.4.a: "A National Bolshevik Germany?"
