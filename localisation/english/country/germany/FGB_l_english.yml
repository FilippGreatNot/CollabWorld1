 FGB_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The Free German Brigades, better known as the Freikorps, are one of the major sides in the German Civil War. After starting a rebellion against the Republic and having disputes with the Old Army of the Kaiserreich too, the Freikorps stands at a perecipe. It is surrounded by enemies like the socialist Bavaria, and more divided than ever. However, as its leader Wolfgang Kapp coughs his way to death, new succesors are approaching the stage. All of them have a very different vision about how Germany should look..."

 FGB_fortify_the_north_desc: "It is a good time to start fortifying key cities close to the borders from where our adversaries can advance.

 FGB_rerecruitment_drive_desc: "Drop your pens! We are in dire need of new people to add to our army, so we will look towards recruiting former officers and army personnel.

 FGB_tank_innovations: "Armour Innovations"

 ## Noske's Path ##

 FGB_noske: "Gustav Noske"
 FGB_noske_desc: "Mr. Noske has been chosen as the preferred candidate due to his ability to communicate well with the population and several governments abroad, as well as being one of only a few people with some power that aren't entirely within the right-wing political camp."
 FGB_noske_ease_unrest: "Stabilise our cabinet"
 FGB_noske_ease_unrest_desc: "Our cabinet is fraught with ministers from the previous regime, while this is not necessarily bad, and is generally good in terms of governance and experience, many of them have been involved in many counts of corruption and scandals in the past, and it would be very damaging to our new administration if we aren't ever to give them the boot, therefore we shall."
 FGB_noske_allow_moderates: "Never another Januaraufstand"
 FGB_noske_allow_moderates_desc: "The Chaos has made way for a significant rise in popularity of various far-left parties, we, as an inherently nationalist force, cannot led these plebs roam the land. Of course we will treat workers with respect, but rioters, who dare to spit on our hero's portraits, do not deserve such treatment."
 FGB_noske_cooperate_with_democrats: "Over from the north"
 FGB_noske_cooperate_with_democrats_desc: "Many elements of the Freikorps are composed of formerly republican or defecting reichswehr units, and it wouldn't be unfair to assume that some of them hold to their Republican or Liberal values, we will use this to our advantage to help them reduce the amount of violence that dominates our cities by instituting them as local Governors, on the upper level, and as enforcers of the law, on the lower level."
 FGB_noske_womens_suffrage: "Befreit die Frauen"
 FGB_noske_womens_suffrage_desc: "It is time we tackle the ever-recurring problem that are women's rights. Women contribute a greater than ever portion of the population, putting them as a majority, and them not being able to vote is quite hypocritical if we are ever to establish a democratic system of governance, thus, we will pass the first laws that will enfranchise, and give amnesty to those who were affected by past repressions."
 FGB_noske_separation_of_church_and_state: "Kultusfreiheit"
 FGB_noske_separation_of_church_and_state_desc: "Despite being a majority-catholic region, many countries around us have implemented secular policies, barring educational institutions and other public services from mandating the teachings of christianity. We shall follow in their footsteps and implement our own secular policies regarding this topic."
 FGB_noske_freikorps_spd: "A Militant SPD"
 FGB_noske_freikorps_spd_desc: "Enough SPD members have gathered here in Stuttgart to form their own official department of the SPD, to possibly govern and lead the future of the lands occupied by the Freikorps. Noske and his allies will unite to form a strong political bloc against the ruthless reactionary forces that so vividly oppose us."
 FGB_noske_september_coalition: "The Summer Coalition"
 FGB_noske_september_coalition_desc: "In order for our Government to succeed, we will form a coalition with other like-minded parties, most notably the DDP and the FDP, who will greatly help us achieving our goals of establishing a free Germany."
 FGB_we_will_enlist_ministers_tt: "§OWe will appoint ministers from both the FDP and the SPD, one will be in charge of reforming the security scene and the other will manage the state of the Economy.§!"
 FGB_noske_rejuvenate_old_industries: "Rejuvenate the Arms Industry"
 FGB_noske_rejuvenate_old_industries_desc: "Several of once famous production hubs have been badly damaged by our frequent wars, and have lost relevance as the workers have moved away or been conscripted. But fear not, for we will take a look at one of them - Oberndorf am Neckar, and try to revitalise the manufacturing hub there, as was its historical heritage."
 FGB_noske_rub_off_kapp_memory: "Recovering from the Putsch"
 FGB_noske_rub_off_kapp_memory_desc: "It is time to take down the short-lived statues of Kapp, revert the degenerate laws his administration has passed, and limit the powers of his former cabinet to become essentially regular politicians. Many steps will be taken to defeat this evil."
 FGB_noske_allow_local_free_elections: "Allow local free elections"
 FGB_noske_allow_local_free_elections_desc: "We will allow the people to vote who is to be their next regional governor, it is much more fair than picking whichever guy we want in charge, since sometimes they wouldn't even be from the region! But, fortunately, that is about to change..."
 FGB_noske_allow_local_free_elections_tt:0 "§YUpon picking the focus, you will receive a temporary spirit granting you weekly stability!§!"
 FGB_noske_press_freedom: "Uphold Press Freedom"
 FGB_noske_press_freedom_desc: "Several liberal and democratic newspapers have been oppressed by Kapp's regime, we will allow them to publicate their articles again under the condition that they do not inherently promote the values of our adversaries, and, oh, that they don't do anything... communist."
 FGB_noske_rebuild_mine_towns: "Rebuild Old Mining Towns"
 FGB_noske_rebuild_mine_towns_desc: "There are only so much mines that are concealed within our own territories, and as such we should give extra care to the ones we have. There are several towns with once prominent mining communities that we have the responsibility to revive."
 FGB_noske_home_arms_act: "Home Arms Act"
 FGB_noske_home_arms_act_desc: "The right to bear arms, a cornerstone policy for both the swiss and america, is here to get exported to germany. We will allow the people to arm themselves to prepare against any external or foreign threat, and increase preparedness for the military among many of our civillians. Of course we will put precautions in place, and enact strict limits for groups of interest, but from how much of our populace have already served in the war or the army, this should be indifferent to them!"
 FGB_noske_broker_a_peace_with_the_protestors: "Broker a peace with the protestors"
 FGB_noske_broker_a_peace_with_the_protestors_desc: "We will begin to have peace talks with the worker's and student's unions that have organised the protests, in an attempt to calm them down.

 FGB_noske_new_day_new_germany: "§8A New German Dawn§!"
 FGB_noske_new_day_new_germany_desc: "What is stopping us from greatness? Our own limits of course! We should look across our borders for a chance to expand our influence and bring much needed democratic reform to every German region we come by."

 FGB_noske_deagrarianise_bavaria: "De-agrarianise the east"
 FGB_noske_deagrarianise_bavaria_desc: "Ever since the bavarian soviets were proclaimed, the governments inside them have set on numerous policies advising against industrialisation and to focus more on self-sustainability and domestic agriculture, while the new farms are welcome, we do not need so many. As such we will begin a process of converting several factories back into working order and to train the new (or rather old) staff that will work in them."
 FGB_noske_raid_communist_barracks: "Raid Communist Barracks"
 FGB_noske_raid_communist_barracks_desc: "With our unexpected invasion, the bavarians have left plenty of guns lying around in their military posts, we will gather as much as we can to help arm ourselves before the rebels find them."

 FGB_noske_integrate_the_militias_desc: "It is time to integrate the rebelling forces into our army and recruit their command, their expertise will be much needed."
 FGB_noske_fate_of_communist_leadership: "Fate of the Bavarian Council"
 FGB_noske_fate_of_communist_leadership_desc: "Eugene, captured, the council, all arrested, and now its time to do what needs to be done. The ideals the government has does not deem the outcome of this process good for the communists."
 FGB_noske_make_munich_capital: "Transfer offices to Munich"
 FGB_noske_make_munich_capital_desc: "Munich is a much larger city with a more defined history, perhaps it would better our legitimacy if we moved our legislative and administrative offices there, after all, Munich is a melting pot of various nationalist factions, in spite of the communist occupation."
 FGB_noske_consolidate_bavaria: "Consolidate our Control"
 FGB_noske_consolidate_bavaria_desc: "We will move significant administrative offices to our own centralised powerbase where the communists will have a tougher time getting to. Along with that, we will move some of the industry away from our own towards the newly conquered lands, just to increase the industrialisation and integration there."
 FGB_noske_integrate_bavaria: "Integrating Bavaria"
 FGB_noske_integrate_bavaria_desc: "It is time we end the riots and bring back complete control over Bavaria once again. Local Bavarian politicians will now have a chance to become state Governors through closely-surveyed elections and will be accepted representation into our council if they succeed in them. With what we have done so far, the rest of our work is simply a formality at this point. It took a lot of work to get here, but it has shown our resolve to restore our homes through iron, blood, and ink. With this experience under our belt, the struggles we have gone through to integrate this state will have taught us well when we inevitably have to do this again with the next state, and the state after that, and the state after that, and the state after tha-"
 FGB_noske_recruit_new_staff: "Recruiting new Generals"
 FGB_noske_recruit_new_staff_desc: "The communist regime has arrested those who had any nationalistic or anti-communist sentiments, we will release them from their unjust confinements and encourage those in hiding to return. Alongside this we will hopefully gather a new group of generals to join our forces."
 FGB_attack_wehrkommando: "Reclaim Hesse"
 FGB_attack_wehrkommando_desc: "Hesse has once been home to the Freikorps that was stationed there, however, ever since the wehrkommando has consolidated the region, contact between our network and the office there have been severly limited, and the wehrkommando is not allowing much to pass. We cannot let these limitations remain, either we fall or they fall and all the freikorps get united!"
 FGB_noske_envelop_local_spd: "Envelop Local SPD Elements"
 FGB_noske_envelop_local_spd_desc: "To ensure the continued stability and security of our nation in its current position, it is crucial that we integrate the local SPD elements into our broader political framework and ideas. This process involves a thorough engagement with local SPD members and their perspectives, aligning their regional priorities with our national objectives. By embracing their input and incorporating their insights into our policies, we can foster a more inclusive and cohesive political environment. This integration will not only strengthen our national unity but also enhance our ability to address local concerns effectively, thereby reinforcing our overall political stability and securing our nation's standing in the present choatic landscape of the 1920's."
 FGB_noske_develop_the_rhine: "Reconstruct the Rhine"
 FGB_noske_develop_the_rhine_desc: "The Rhineland is a historic center of industry and prosperity, and now its ours. We should do the best we can with the resources we got conquering it, and nourish the ever growing army with as many manufacturing hubs it needs to produce its guns. We will provide employment benefits and grant funds for existing factories to expand."
 FGB_noske_liberalise_the_people: "Liberalise the People"
 FGB_noske_liberalise_the_people_desc: "As we patrolled the newly conquered Rhineland, it was clear things wouldn’t be easy. All over the place were symbolic protests, both major and minor. The Rhineish people were very much loyal to their old regime, and a couple of weeks will be nowhere near enough to fix it. It is almost cult like the following the previous regime had instilled in them. Fortunately for us, there is also evidence of purges and small resistance cells to their regime hidden underground. By working with these cells, we will be able to slowly but surely convert the population from their recently destroyed cult with reforms, infrastructure projects, and propaganda. Close to france, it is no wonder many have adopted francophone identites, especially in areas such as the Palatinate and the Saarland. It is for that reason that many there were participating in the Spring of Nations, and thus were subject to spreading or consuming many liberal ideals. We will attempt to bring back this fervor into the Rhineland by manipulating our ideology as being comparable to theirs."
 FGB_noske_power_to_political_minorities: "Power over to the Political Minorities"
 FGB_noske_power_to_political_minorities_desc: "The Rhineland was never truly connected towards the Prussian nation - They have their own regional identities and cultures roughly encompassing the area, and as such we will enable local parties to participate in local elections, as well as support more regional identities overall. This is definitely not a deliberate attempt to weaken the power of the parties of the former Wehrkommando. Given how important the Rhineland was to Germany and even Prussia in the past, it is no surprise at how many political groups attempted to gain influence there. Given the previous regime's nature, it won’t be surprising to learn that many of them were either neglected or violently repressed outright. While some will say giving them any sense of power is dangerous, that is not entirely true. We are simply slotting them in neatly into their local governments. They will not have the influence to change everything from the inside, merely the cause to make moves on the local level while we focus on the national level. "
 FGB_noske_pacify_local_militias: "Pacify Regional Militias"
 FGB_noske_pacify_local_militias_desc: "There still remains much of the resistance against our Government, perpetrated by former elements of the Wehrkommando. This is inacceptable in our eyes. We will thus attempt to break them apart by calling general strikes and awarding/pardoning those who surrender swiftly. When the previous regime collapsed, they didn’t go quietly. Among other things, they left behind Guerilla units to slow us down by any means necessary. Every week, reports come in of more terrorist attacks in Moselland, and those are just the “major incidents.” Even comparatively minor incidents are still proving to be quite the nuisance for us. Fortunately, we have two advantages here. One, they are largely located in Moselland. Two, they are not actually fully united despite a common foe. Most of them only want minor concessions which can be granted to us, with many even willing to switch sides. Only a small amount of them will require a more permanent solution to the problem."
 FGB_noske_amnesty_to_generals: "Amnesty to the Generals"
 FGB_noske_amnesty_to_generals_desc: "During the war, many conscripts were called on to fight, and many fought bravely. These people were often awarded for their actions and by the end of it had found themselves to maintain high-ranking roles, such as those of a General. The Generals of the Wehrkommando are just like those latter men, servants of a regime in wars they do not wish to fight or do not wish to support, but forced in the face of threats and complete suspension. We will attempt to reconcile much of Düsseldorf's former staff, especially those who had links with the Freikorps before. As we scourge the prisons in Stuttgart, it is filled with talent going to waste. Most of them didn’t seem all too enthusiastic about their side, they simply did it for the sake of their homes. Seeing as their homes have been pacified and returned to a peaceful state of rebuilding, perhaps they could be turned to our advantage. Though many will simply return home to their families and previous jobs, a very powerful few in particular will be willing to not just join us, but even lead our forces into battle. They have proven model prisoners too, so it seems they also know we could use their services. Why put such a useful opportunity to waste. "
 FGB_noske_exile_the_kaiser: "Exile the Kaiser"
 FGB_noske_exile_the_kaiser_desc: "The Kaiser is a major symbol for those still left resisting. We will treat them right by Exiling their hero to the Netherlands, who would be glad to meet him. We will recycle our actions into views of supporting the monarchy, but alas removing the Monarch that caused the country's problems, and thus having no real basis for a full resurrection of the Hohenzollern dynasty."

 FGB_noske_inwards_and_outwards_desc: "Today is a day of celebration. The reds to our east have been pacified, the valuable Rhineland is where it belongs, and the madmen are dead. People gather around their tables for food and drink, the politicians spark patriotism all around, and we all celebrate that the west belongs to us. But not all is well, the rest of the German people are still under oppression. So let tonight be glorious, for it will be the last easy one for some time. It is time that we look towards unifying the rest of Germany, but as well as liberating territories that were taken from our vaterland; Our colonies, Ostafrika and Kamerun; Our frontiers, Eupen-malmedy and Nord-Schleswig, as well as looking beyond our former borders, perhaps creating a greater Ostafrika..."

 FGB_noske_to_the_east_desc: "In our east lie our strongest foes; The republic, the remnants of the illegitimate democratic Government that was declared at the end of the Great War; The Spartakusbund, an adversary that many of us would like to see dead, and finally, the Provinces of Silesia, currently under occupation by the Polish Liberation Army. We have everything we need, and now we must march east to act as the bulwark against those monsters in Russia and Poland. We do this not for Western Europe, but for our beloved fatherland."
 FGB_noske_back_to_berlin: "Back to Berlin"
 FGB_noske_back_to_berlin_desc: "Though the government that collapsed was technically based in Weimar, our home is in Berlin. Without it, could we claim to even succeed Germany or even Prussia? Those imposters may have the capital, but we have the spirit of true Germans and the resources to back up our claim to the city. No reasonable man would simply give it up without a fight. Men, load up your weapons and make your way to the temporary border. Tonight we rest up, tomorrow we push it all the way to the Reichstag. The dawn will come to face our greatest battles yet, the battle for Berlin and the battle for Germany. Only one winner will be considered, and it will be us! Will we strike a deal with the Republic or will hundreds of thousands of our bretheren lie dead in the face of war?"

 FGB_noske_offer_the_republicans_peaceful_reunification_desc: "The North and the South, not a tale of the best of brothers, but we are family nonetherless.

 FGB_noske_arrest_liebknecht_and_luxemburg_desc: "Liebknecht and Luxemburg are the Hades and Cerberus to our cause, the root of all pain experienced all throughout Germany.

 FGB_noske_deradicalise_the_people_desc: "We have arrived at a stage where we are no more fighting over battles and fronts in other countries, but within our own; Thousands of persons still claim loyalty to the long-dead KPD, KAPD, USPD and other rogue communist organisations. If we want to have East Germany secured, we must first rid this pestilence that had long-arrived at our lands, and extinguish the flames of Revolution."
 FGB_noske_fund_pomeranian_reconstruction: "Fund Pomeranian Reconstruction"
 FGB_noske_fund_pomeranian_reconstruction_desc: "Hit by constant war and austerity, the Region we refer to as Pommern is a farcry from its glory days during the Imperial age; Its once-great dockyards lay in ruins, its offices have their roofs open to the sky, and many industrial hubs have seen their plants filled with rubble, debris and the wrecks of war. The people there lay in absolute poverty as the degenerate policies of the Spartakusbund have done nothing to alleviate them, and we will come there to fix their problems once and for all, a solution shall come!"

 FGB_noske_fold_in_prussian_nationalists_desc: "The socialist revolutions in the east were never strong enough to break up the Prussian identity. Even after nearly a decade of rule, there are still many praying to christ and reminiscing about the great expanses of the old Kingdom of Prussia, we will use their patriotic fevor to fuel our own interest and put down the unrest that is actively harming our efforts to integrate the area.

While not fully revoking the use of the German language, or its flag, the people there are beginning national revivals in the uses of their own local cultures and customs, such as the opening of new Sorbian language schools in Gorlitz, or the two-striped Saxon flag appearing above Governmental offices in Leipzig and Zwickau.

Though the poles took one of our most resource rich regions, the resources there are ones we can make up for in the rest of Germany. Not to mention, a resource rich ally could prove helpful with what comes after reunification.

 FGB_noske_to_the_west_desc: "Though we say the west is ours, there is one more state in western Germany left to do. Not only that, but it may well be our most important target to date. Among other things, this has the port city of Wilhelmshaven and access to the sea. During the Great War, we felt the consequences of not trading first hand with the Entente blockade starving thousands to death. Now that the blockade is gone, that sea port will help us secure trade from more than just our immediate neighbors. Not only that, but Belgium has something that belongs to us. "
 FGB_noske_strike_at_the_syndicates: "Strike at the Syndicates!"
 FGB_noske_strike_at_the_syndicates_desc: "Once again, the red menace is on our doorstep. Unlike with Bavaria however, there is no peaceful option we can work with. These are not the first socialists we have fought, nor will they be the last. This is merely a stepping stone to uniting our homeland, and their sea access will prove a valuable tool in this effort. Only then when these lands are ours can we truly say the west is secured in our hands. "
 FGB_noske_reurbanise_westfalen: "Forced Reurbanisation of Westphalia"
 FGB_noske_reurbanise_westfalen_desc: "It seems the moment we lose Westphalia, it falls behind everything else. What else can we expect when reds take charge of the state? It seems drastic action is needed. We will put the land back into use like it was the last time we had it. Granted this will come at the expense of the locals, which will increase resistance to our efforts. But if they wanted things to end well, they wouldn’t have turned towards the left."
 FGB_noske_put_strikers_back_into_dockyards: "Put the strikers back into Dockyards"
 FGB_noske_put_strikers_back_into_dockyards_desc: "This whole mess started with the navy's mutinies which quickly spread to the rest of Germany, turning into a series of varying revolts and uprisings that the Government, and its later claimants, had a hard time crushing. Having people go back to working on ships would be a symbolic defeat for any revolutionaries who see it. It is also poetic to have the ones who started this chaos be the ones to fix it. Once we reunify. We will need to get our navy up and running again bigger and stronger than before. We do not need them doing this again."
 FGB_noske_bring_down_the_bremen_soviet: "Bring down the Bremen Soviet"
 FGB_noske_bring_down_the_bremen_soviet_desc: "Though not the largest city, Bremen served as an important center for the syndicate's regime. There are even more symbols to set regime there and in their capital of Wilhelmshaven. We will do more than simply tear down the symbols in their sleep, nor will we be subtle about it. This will be a public event. The people will be promised a grand event for all who remember the Bremen Soviet, and when they do, we will show them just what we think of their symbols."
 FGB_noske_purge_members: "Purge Syndicalist Members"
 FGB_noske_purge_members_desc: "Needless to say, the local syndicalists were not a fan of what we just did to the Bremen Soviet. However, that was the plan. A large number of syndicalists just revealed themselves to the authorities because they couldn’t resist an opportunity to do what they do best, minorly inconveniences us because they have no lives. In addition to revealing themselves, our agents managed to follow some of them back to hidden bases where even more members were revealed than we had even planned to. With this last step of the war, the syndicalists will be raided and hunted down until they are too weak to pose a threat to us ever again."

With our power growing once again, it is time we undo one of these dishonours and take back what the Belgians took from us.

Though they didn’t collapse, the Belgiums are far from in a stable position. Getting new territories after the Great War did nothing to help their ravaged resources, not to mention the Germans in the area not wanting to be a part of the state they just fought against. Now that our state is showing some signs of being put back together, even the most reluctant Germans will wish to return to their fatherland. Our diplomats are en route to Brussels as they speak with our offer to buy back out land. "

 FGB_rohm_root_out_the_liberal_freikorps_staff_desc: "Within our ranks there are the soft hearted who could very well be tempted by the siren song of the communists. They call themselves many names, moderates, liberals, social democrats, but no matter what tag they call themselves they are all equally guilty of exposing the entirety of the Freikorps with their weakness. These men and women will be cut from us like a cancer, and then the most inoffensive will live to tell the tale of how the rest weren’t so lucky."

 FGB_rohm_purge_disloyal_generals_desc: "Among even our higher echelons there are men who see Röhm and his vision with suspicion, calling him a communist or worse. These detractors cannot be allowed to continue wielding so much power, least they betray all of Germany (Mainly Röhm). They will serve as a perfect example to the fact that no one, no matter how powerful, can stand in the way of our great leader."
 FGB_rohm_the_second_revolution: "The Second Revolution"
 FGB_rohm_the_second_revolution_desc: "The communist revolution is a false messiah, a poisoned chalice set to pervert the spirit of Germany. We are the true German revolution, the cause which shall see the German race and her workers freed from both the royalist and stagnant past and the decadent and distorted future of Luxemburg’s clique. We, and only we, are the true red banner."

 FGB_rohm_empower_the_sturmabteilung_desc: "The Sturmbteilung is only one out of dozens of militias in the Freikorps, and as Röhm’s most loyal and oldest followers, he must ensure that they stand atop the other groups. From here on out, the Sturmabteilung will be favored by our administration, getting the bulk of new recruits, funding, and weapons to ensure no other group can threaten its dominance."

Luckily for Germany, we have the cure for such an ailment. Bullets. Lots of them. Enough to make entire blocks run red.

 FGB_rohm_weaken_the_stahlhelm_desc: "If any group among the Freikorps can threaten to subvert our reign now, it would be the Stahlhelm. The only solution then is to strike before they even think of betraying us.

 FGB_rohm_mass_employment_program_desc: "The end of the Great War has seen millions of men return home without a clear goal, without a future. Most people can only look out at the ruins of Germany born out of our civil war and despair, but Rohm sees a chance to rebuild better.

 FGB_rohm_assign_a_new_cabinet_desc: "We can no longer merely function as a junta, especially not when there are scores of talented men under Rohm whose talents are wasted merely over not having a rank. A new proper civilian government must be built so that we may ensure the proper functioning of the new state."
 FGB_rohm_enlist_new_brownshirts: "Enlist New Brownshirts"
 FGB_rohm_enlist_new_brownshirts_desc: "As more of Germany will soon be in our grasp, Rohm will require more ears and boots to keep the new cities in check and root out their subversives. As such we will begin establishing new formations of Brownshirts before they are even needed, creating a vast pool of enforcers in reserve able to help in policing duties when needed for now, and serve independently once they’re needed."

 FGB_rohm_filler_focus_name_2_desc: "Even after the numerous purges, thousands of brave German men enlisted into patriotic militias are willing to come to our aid.

 POLITICS_ERNST_ROHM_DESC: "Ernst Röhm is the principal leader of the leftist DAP, known also as the Syndicalist DAP or SDAP. Growing up with close ties to Hiedler, ultimately, the party rifted into twain upon the nature of Ernst's beliefs and the fate of his supposed homosexuality. In 1921, within its 31st congress, the party erupted into mountains of disputes over various issues. Eventually, one side moved to a different meeting locatio to discuss certain terms in peace, and thus the party was split. Many still consider it one entity, the NSDAP, but everyone grounded in reality knows that it is anything but, and they are only tied together because of their common hates and common goals, to shoot commies, and to unify all Germans. And that, my friend, is what Ernst Röhm intends to exactly do. Glory to the Führer."

 FGB_recycle_old_planes_desc: "There are many planes left unused in our stockpiles, while some are available for active duty, others are in critically damaged conditions, or have corroded over time due to disrepair or misrepair. We will take out some of the more functional of these and convert them into newer and more efficient models."
 FGB_aerial_innovations: "Aerial Innovations"
 FGB_aerial_innovations_desc: "It is time for us to fly into a new stage of aviation warfare, where speed is key, bombs are money and weakening civilian morale is a keycode to success."

 ## Economic Branch ##
 
 FGB_reconstruction: "§YBegin Reconstruction§!"
 FGB_reconstruction_desc: "We will put together a new agency focusing on revitalising economic sectors that were hit hard by the war, of course many were, but the agency is focusing on those that were hit the worst, and we will hopefully provide sufficient funding, enough of a point that they will become relevant again."
 FGB_resource_smuggling: "Resource Smuggling"
 FGB_resource_smuggling_desc: "At a time where trade is severly limited, we must resort to a sequence of minor cross-border operations smuggling raw resources into our own. This includes the theft of coal and haematite (iron) ore from our adversaries, but if it becomes too public, it might risk the security of our regime. We must stay vigilant!"
 FGB_repair_the_countryside: "Repair the Countryside"
 FGB_repair_the_countryside_desc: "One of the industrial sectors that have been hit the hardest was agriculture. Beautiful green fields are now a canvas full of holes, lines, and old wrecks of abandoned machinery. We must not let this stand."
 FGB_repairing_damaged_roads_decisions_unlocked_tt: "§YUnlocks decisions allowing you to remove the state modifier 'Damaged Roads'§!"
 FGB_repair_the_countryside_tt: "§RIf in addition you control Bavaria, the effects of this focus will extend to include it§!"
 FGB_welfare_programmes: "Welfare Programmes"
 FGB_welfare_programmes_desc: "We can't let the people stay poor! Many of our most skilled generals, officers and politicians have fallen into a level of poverty or destitution easily comparable to the victorian age! Thus we will fund an initiative to give funding to those who need it, by cutting spending to obsolete sectors, we will have enough to spend where necessary!"
 FGB_combat_inflation: "Combat Inflation"
 FGB_combat_inflation_desc: "There is a rampant inflation crisis going ahead, if we don't do anything about it, prices are going to skyrocket and a loaf of bread is going to cost 2200 Freie Marks! We will induce deflation as well as put measures to increase confidence in our currency, if things turn for the worse we can just devaluate our currency and make a new 'Neufreimarken' coin at a 100:1 exchange ratio."
 FGB_coop_corp: "Cooperate With the Corporations"
 FGB_coop_corp_desc: "There are several large companies and agglomerates that dominate our economy, maybe we'll try to collaborate or cooperate with some of them offering exclusive deals in exchange? Their military assistance could be really helpful."
 FGB_tax_foreign: "Tax Foreign Companies"
 FGB_tax_foreign_desc: "To support domestic industry, we will begin taxing any company doing work in our land. Of course we won't tax any of our close allies and possible partners, but it is important to take steps such as these to make our economy an independent one."
 FGB_etatism: "Reinforce Etatism"
 FGB_etatism_desc: "We will implement a series of policies allowing us to take control over the economy, and achieve a suitable level of state-issued capitalism, this is necessary to help us fund our other projects directly and to help us recover quicker, with a broken economy such as this one, who is there to object?"
 FGB_market_liberalism: "Promote Trade"
 FGB_market_liberalism_desc: "Isolating for so long is one sure hell of a way to wreck the economy! We will not follow in the footsteps of the fallen Qing, as such we will open our market to other countries and allow for trade to pass by with limited tariffs."
 FGB_modernise_taxes: "Modernise the Taxation System"
 FGB_modernise_taxes_desc: "Currently our nation is riddled with a long list of taxation policies that don't really fit the era we are in, we will take steps in removing them or shaping them to be more future proof than they are, currently."
 FGB_nationalise_industry: "Nationalise Key Industries"
 FGB_nationalise_industry_desc: "As of now, much of our economy is controlled by french and federal-american companies, of which the governments we do not support, we will nationalise their most important stakes in our industries and rip off the wretched hand of the devil!" 
 FGB_increase_tariffs: "Increase Tariffs"
 FGB_increase_tariffs_desc: "A good way to sway away unwanted influence is to tax the goods imported by the countries we hate, and as such we will do so. These won't apply to governments we find friendly overseas."
 FGB_increase_exports: "Increase Exportations"
 FGB_increase_exports_desc: "Is Baden-Wurttemberg not one of the most prosperous areas in the former reich? It is time we used some of that money to fund exports to other countries so that our products can be traded and sold elsewhere, and maybe Swabian beer will become more known than the Bavarian brew..."
 FGB_buy_businesses: "Buy-out Failing Local Businesses"
 FGB_buy_businesses_desc: "Not all of the businesses which are failing in our country as of currently have a bad foundation, in fact, most of them have simply been tattered because of the war. All of the consumers went to hide in their homes or saw the bloodied fields of Flanders, we will strive to move away from this ghastly atmosphere and procure sufficient investments to keep many of our own businesses afloat."
 FGB_autarky: "Autarky With a Swabian Twist"
 FGB_autarky_desc: "A good reason why our economy fell as it had was that we relied too much on foreign trade, we should focus more on self-sufficient measures and enact a level of protectionism around our economy wherever needed."
 FGB_market_decentralisation: "Complete the Market Decentralisation Process"
 FGB_market_decentralisation_desc: "It is time we pass the last few policies to allow Germany to finally relish in what a true Free Market is! We will shape our economic model after the successful western model and add only the most minute of measures to protect it from failure."
 FGB_complete_recovery: "§GComplete Recovery§!"
 FGB_complete_recovery_desc: "Our economy is finally out of the gutter..."
 FGB_rebuild_schools: "Fund New Schools"
 FGB_rebuild_schools_desc: "Many buildings of both lower and higher education have been damaged all over the country as a result of frequent war and conflict, with these brief areas of peace we should focus on improving their foundations and rebuilding them to get the joyful yells of children bounce through the corridors again!"
 FGB_open_new_hospitals: "Open New Hospitals"
 FGB_open_new_hospitals_desc: "We will decrease the pressure on the limited hospitals we do have by expanding existing ones and opening others in the poorest of areas. Hopefully this is enough to tend to all those who are wounded."
 FGB_invigorate_the_german_economy: "Invigorate the German Industry"
 FGB_invigorate_the_german_economy_desc: "It is time for us to expand our goals to cover the whole Vaterland, from the prosperous Rhineland, to the beautiful shores of Pomerania, they all need a level of interest and investment from the Government in order to develop their local industries, and launch Germany's industrial potency beyond its climax during the imperial times."
 FGB_invigorate_the_german_economy_idea: "Invigorate The German Economy"

 FGB_revitalise_southern_industry: "Revitalise Southern Industry"
 FGB_revitalise_southern_industry_desc: "New Factories will be constructed to accomodate the growing population, this is also to decrease the southern region's unemployment and to increase its economic output drastically."
 FGB_develop_the_rhine: "Developing the Rhineland"
 FGB_develop_the_rhine_desc: "To significantly enhance our manufacturing capabilities, we must undertake a comprehensive reconstruction and development of the Rhine region, restoring it to its former status as Germany's industrial powerhouse. This initiative involves modernizing existing factories, building new infrastructure, and investing in advanced technologies to boost production efficiency and output. By revitalizing the Rhine's industrial potential, we aim to attract skilled labor, foster innovation, and increase our competitive edge in key sectors. This will not only strengthen our economic position but also ensure that the Rhine becomes a vital engine of growth and prosperity for Germany once again."
 FGB_industrialising_lower_saxony: "Industrialising Lower Saxony"
 FGB_industrialising_lower_saxony_desc: "Lower Saxony is an area with lower elevation, little mountains and plenty of space to put new factories in. We are using this region's natural flatness to our advantage to do just that."
 FGB_support_east_german_businesses: "Support East German Businesses"
 FGB_support_east_german_businesses_desc: "Capitalism has suffered under the spartakusbund, thats why we should fund an initiative to revive the industry there, and fund enough to keep most businesses afloat, and of course help them retrain their staff so that they can eventually move away from government help."
 FGB_enrich_the_northeast: "Enrich the Northeast"
 FGB_enrich_the_northeast_desc: "Tons of untapped potential that was hidden away with the greed of the spartakusbund, all lying in silesia and lausatia, we will fund projects to recover some of the lost industry there, get new factories going, build up the dockyards in pomerania and decrease the wealth inequality there again, it is, after all, the homeland of the prussian nation, excluding the occupied east and west prussia of course."
 FGB_new_currency: "A New Reichsmark"
 FGB_new_currency_desc: "Our economy has been ridden of enough issues, but there is still one issue left to resolve; our current currency is worth less than that of other countries we are meant to rival, and thus we will resort to making a new flagship currency, stronger than before, with a new national bank to go along with it!"
 FGB_further_oil_exploitation: "Further our Oil Exploitation"
 FGB_further_oil_exploitation_desc: "Northern Germany is full of untapped black gold, hidden by war and greed, it is time we shall seek it with our united german hands and put it to good use. We will begin by expanding the already rich area around the weser, and then go on to build new plants around the entirety of Northern Lower Saxony as well as Schleswig-Holstein."
 FGB_reform_our_tax_policies: "Reform our Taxing Policies"
 FGB_reform_our_tax_policies_desc: "Our taxing policies have been stagnant for some time. We never had the time to reform it while reuniting Germany, leaving our policy one meant for the southwest portion of Germany alone. It came under a little bit of strain from our first conquest, but now it is stretched too far. It must be reformed before it fully collapses. It will take more than simply expanding the current policies, they will need to be reworked entirely. Fortunately for us, we have a variety of pre-great war policies to choose from."
 FGB_put_the_economy_back_into_the_hands_of_the_people: "Put the Economy back into the hands of the People"
 FGB_put_the_economy_back_into_the_hands_of_the_people_desc: "During the civil war, more and more businesses were taken away from the civilians for the sake of government centralization and to make sure they weren’t being sabotaged from within. This is not a denouncement however, we did it too as a necessary measure, but times are different now. We must search through the records of the previous regimes to see who owned what and if they could still regain their businesses. In addition, any regional laws preventing the people from owning businesses will be given a second look to see if they are still needed."
 FGB_total_market_freedoms: "Total Market Freedoms"
 FGB_total_market_freedoms_desc: "With Germany back on the world stage, we have much catching up to do. It was foolish of the Kaiser to assume Germany alone could truly handle the demands of modern society. We must open our markets to what’s left of the world so that we may slowly begin to recover with whoever will listen as well as establish ourself as a benevolent force for any who wish to rebuild. Though willing allies are hard to come by, even the reluctant can be turned towards our side with enough economic pressure."
 FGB_lower_average_tax: "Lower the Average Tax"
 FGB_lower_average_tax_desc: "With our country more open to international trade, money is becoming less and less of an issue by the day. With this burden being lessened on our state, we could do likewise to our citizenry by lowering the taxes the average man must pay. Our men have calculated that our state could easily manage a tax break. This would also increase the buying power of our citizens now that they have more money to spend on goods that would otherwise have gone to paying off their high wartime taxes."
 FGB_protectionist_desires: "Protectionist Desires"
 FGB_protectionist_desires_desc: "We do not need outside help for our economy to recover. As far as we are concerned, our issues come from an overstretched administration, and less from our international isolation. What we need to do is safeguard our progress from any destabilizing threats which can come from foreign markets. The American collapse a few years ago is proof of this, with one of the last stable economies proving to be the lifeline many could not rely upon. We will not make their same mistake, instead focusing on Germany first."
 FGB_bolster_the_reichsmark: "Bolster the Reichsmark"
 FGB_bolster_the_reichsmark_desc: "While the Reichsmark is proving itself useful, it is not universally accepted. Both the pre-war currency as well as several civil war era currencies are still in circulation throughout our country, making large scale trade nearly impossible. Not only that, it seems we miscalculated how much of the currency we needed to have in circulation. Fortunately, both of these issues are solvable at the same time. Firstly we will offer anyone with their old currencies to trade those in for the new reichsmark. If anyone refuses, well there’s always legal means to make the currency worthless."
 FGB_form_the_nationaler_gesundheitsdienst: "Form the Nationaler Gesundheitsdienst"
 FGB_form_the_nationaler_gesundheitsdienst_desc: "One of the things keeping our population from their full potential, especially early on, was memories of the great war. When the people were near the frontlines, or even heard stories of it, the horror of the trenches was brought to the homefront. As the war ended, that horror was brought to the streets of Berlin itself. During that time, people who were shell shocked were simply thought to be weak and unable to handle the responsibilities of war. With the founding of a national health service, the peoples suffering can be minimized, and our men returned to the front."
 FGB_freedom_of_education: "Freedom of Education"
 FGB_freedom_of_education_desc: "With Germany factionalized, educational institutions either collapsed, or became highly regionalized and biased via ideology. While the ideology thing must be dealt with, we have found that regional identities in school actually help foster the youths' education. Rather than restrict people to a harsh nationalistic idea, having a mix of nationalist and regionalist education gives them just the right mix of loyalty to the country, and the love of their home. Of course there will be national requirements, but we will overall be relatively laissez faire about it."
 FGB_rebuild_university_of_cologne: "Re-establish the University of Köln"
 FGB_rebuild_university_of_cologne_desc: "Once one of the most prestigious learning centers in Europe, with the history to match it. Yet we have let it fall to ruin. In order for future generations to better prepare for issues like these, we must train them well. We will have them thoroughly analyze the events of the past few years and why every nation reacted the way they did. With its resources restored, the university will have the ability to send daring students to international locations deemed safe enough by the government in order to study their unique situations and how they survived the great collapse after the great war."

 fgb.1.t: "The Matter of Army Reform"
 fgb.1.d: "Several generals have come to the command to tell us a variety of ideas, and there seems to have formed 2 distinct general ideas as to how the Army Reform may go about. The first camp argues that a quick offensive is necessary to avoid the horrors that were bourne in the depths of the nasty gas-filled trenches, while the other insinuates that careful planning, combined with better logistics, is far more superior, as such a frontline can keep moving and delay or suspend the need for trenche warfare entirely. The Command concludes with..."

 fgb.3.a: "We will take back Munich by force!"
 fgb.3.b: "Let us demand instead..."
 fgb.4.t: "The Freikorps Captures Bavaria"
 fgb.4.d: "Germany is in shock as the streets of Munich are filled with marching soldiers of the nationalist Freikorps. Last evening, the troops assumed full control of the city and the Bavarian Socialists declared their capitulation. This marks a shift in the German civil war as factions begin to usurp one another to take Germany for themselves. The local corporal stated that the city has been totally cleansed from the bolshevik disease. Our own reports are confirming this, as many houses of old socialists have been burnt to the ground. Many soldiers were also hanged, which brought criticism to the Freikorps from the international community."
 fgb.4.a: "A Major Shift"
 fgb.5.t: "Victory over the Bavarians"
 fgb.5.d: "We have succeeded, where it may pose a serious challenge for some, it was a challenge that our forces could easily defeat, and this is only one in a number of victories we shall encouter! \n\"One-by-one, we will defeat any foe that comes across us, if it means that our Vaterland will be whole again\". \n§RSoldaten, Weiter!§!"
 fgb.5.a: "JAWOL!"
 fgb.6.t: "Fate of the Soviet Council"
 fgb.6.d: "Eugene Levine and his goons have finally been captured and put in our prisons, now its just the time to decide what to do with them. \n\nIt is obvious that we can't begin a fair trial, not when our courts are already filled with thousands of other worthless communists, and under our anti-communist leadership, we don't see why we have to. \n\nThe verdict is obvious; There is only one thing to do."
 fgb.6.a: "Execute them"
 fgb.7.t: "Moving our offices"
 fgb.7.d: "We have decided to move our offices to the bavarian capital and historic center of Munich, while it may be unpopular to some, especially those still weary about our takeover, the upper leadership in fact praises this change. \n\nSeveral reporters have commented that the freikorps is getting a rise in legitimacy, and that it won't be long before we start establishing official relationships with other countries."
 fgb.7.a: "Now to start removing all the rubble..."
 fgb.8.t: "Hitler offers his services"
 fgb.8.d: "A young soldier has approached the council, with a clear condescending voice and the passion with the power of a bull, he has offered to take up a vacant position within our ranks to improve the policy against the marxists, the one thing is, some have revealed that he has links to a number of nationalistic and occultist organisations, but rohm, a friend of his, and one of our own, has argued that these sentiments are indifferent to ours, seeing as we have defeated a communist foe and are against any proponent who dares to align with them. \n\nOne final question that needs to be answered is, should we let him in?"
 fgb.8.a: "Sure, we could use an extra helping hand"
 fgb.8.b: "His military skills could come in handy"
 fgb.8.c: "No! We will not let his anti-semitic emotions pollute our ranks!"

 fgb.10.t: "The Freikorps unite Germany!"
 fgb.10.d: "The Free German Brigades, better known as Freikorps, have today declared the so called Wiedervereinigung of Germany to be complete. Freikorps flags were raised in Berlin while a march was also held to show the power of the brigades and project power regionally. This marks a major change in the world as Germany will now once again play a big role in global geopolitics. What the new government will do remains uncertain, but either way it will certainly have effects on Europe as a whole. \n\n§bFreikorps Voran!§!"
 fgb.10.a: "Thousands of Women grieve while the Men cheer"
 fgb.11.t: "Bavaria Rejects!"
 fgb.11.d: "The Council in Regensburg has refused our demands for subjugation, as of now they seem to wish to resist our talks and mobilise in response. If there is anything we can do about it..."
 fgb.11.a: "Is to attack them at an instant!"
 fgb.11.b: "... But to prepare first before fighting."
 fgb.12.t: "The Issue of Women's Suffrage"
 fgb.12.d: "One of our planned policies is to allow women a chance to vote; For far too long women have been disenfranchised and oppressed by an authoritarian and mainly partiarchical series of governments, but now under our administration they have a chance to break that line. \n\nThe question is, how should we go about implementing this policy?"
 fgb.12.a: "We will make modest reforms to bring more people in!"

 fgb.13.t: "The Freikorps storm Düsseldorf!"
 fgb.13.d: "At 18:08, this very evening, Freikorps troops have broken through the seige that occurred at the city gates of Düsseldorf and captured the Wehrkommando Dusseldorf's Capital Building, along with capturing a variety of other critical cities. As the Wehrkommando's army got overwhelmed, the government was forced to sign a peace deal, signing off their entire territory to the undeterred Freikorps' Administration. The future bodes well with the Freikorps, but the question remains..."

 FGB_noske_victory_over_wehrkommando_tt: "§GThe focus tree will expand...§!"
 fgb.14.t: "The Consolidation of the West"
 fgb.14.d: "We have achieved nearly complete control over the entire southwestern half of Germany, as of now there are only 3 factions that could oppose us, 2 of them being worthwhile foes, it is time that we begin planning our attacks carefully. The final few stages of reunification are approaching..."
 fgb.14.a: "We shall unify Germany as our predecessors had done in 1870!"
 FGB_noske_unification_nearly_complete_tt: "The focus tree will be greatly expanded, allowing for more non-linear gameplay."
 fgb.15.t: "Fate of Himmler"
 fgb.15.d: "We have captured the fabled man, the ultranationalist himself, Heinrich Himmler, word has spread that the driver that drove the wagon to get here has gotten ailed off an unidentified illness, some even have pointed out that a revolting stench has seemed to pour out of the car once the doors have been opened. \n\nThe situation at hand is not about that incident, however, and it is instead what to do with this mythical devil. Many have argued to let him be, and perhaps join the Freikorps one day as a central member, but his attitudes, combined with his extremist desires, have got him reminding us more of Kapp and Ludendorff than anything else, as if they even wished to be compared to him."
 fgb.15.a: "He shall spend his final days rotting in hell, where he belongs."
 fgb.16.t: "The recapture of the region of Eupen"
 fgb.16.d: "Our troops have marched through the crudely constructed city walls and have conquered the towns of Eupen and Spa. With the help of the local populace, a local governorate has been established allowing for us to peaceful annex and integrate the region thereafter. The reponse from the opposition government has led us to silence, as no other soldiers have been spotted marching into the area, and only the local garrisons seemed to have resisted. We take this as a sign that the government at hand is either distracted or gives little care in our shenanigans in the area."
 fgb.16.a: "One more region to our vaterland..."
 fgb.17.t: "The Germans demand Eupen!"
 fgb.17.d: "The German minister of foreign affairs has suggested to us that we concede the German-majority region of Eupen-malmedy, the question is, should we give in?"
 fgb.17.a: "You mean we don't have to call them belgians anymore?"
 fgb.17.b: "We will call their bluff"
 fgb.18.t: "The Germans demand Eupen!"
 fgb.18.d: "The German minister of foreign affairs has suggested to us that we concede the German-majority region of Eupen-malmedy, the question is, should we give in?"

 fgb.19.a: "Sehr Gut..."
 fgb.20.t: "The Western Government demands our Subjugation!"
 fgb.20.d: "A letter has been sent, from Gustav Noske himself, urging us to concede to the Military's demands and to give up control of Berlin and the surrounding areas, as well as transfer Germany's governorship to them. If we do not give in to these demands, Noske further says, then the Freikorps will threaten us with War..."

 fgb.21.c: "Let us not disatisfy the People, the Conservatives will win!"
 fgb.22.t: "Election Day!"
 fgb.22.d: "Thank you all for gathering here today, we are proud of announcing our first general election, the first in the Reich, the first in a United Germany, it is a luxury that you are all seated here to experience this moment in time, a fine bookmark in History. With full confidence, I can say that each eligible citizen has now submitted their ballots and the election results are due to arrive shortly, to be represented onto this screen here. \n\nAny questions?"
 fgb.22.a: "May the best man win!"
 fgb.23.t: "No party secures a Majority!"
 fgb.23.d: "Unfortunately, the results of the recent election have proven that the country is still divided, although politically, and that all major coalitions have not managed to gain objective majorities in the provisional parliament. It is sad to see, but we can always govern under a minority government and try to gain support later on, perhaps a party might gain the majorty?"
 fgb.23.a: "What?!"
 fgb.24.t: "The Kleindeutsche Idea"
 fgb.24.d: "The 'Kleindeutsche' is an idea labelled by many historians and experts to refer to the current national situation concerning the status of Germany and Austria. It originated in the 19th century, during Germany's reunification under prussia, where Austria, a country with a substantial German/German-speaking population, was never convened to join. Today, as it stands, as how we are united once again after the Great War and how Austria has been reduced to mainly it's German-speaking parts, the issue has come about again, what we should ask is, should this separation remain?"
 fgb.24.a: "We will petition the Austrian Parliament"
 fgb.25.t: "The Freikorps Storm Berlin!"
 fgb.25.d: "A famous photo has been captured of the Brandenburg gate; 9,000 Freikorps troops, waving their flags, cheering on, while civilians gather all around. This wasn't a photoshoot, it occured today at 15:08 at the Afternoon. The Freikorps have finally returned to the old capital after an exhausting battle, with tens of thousands of affected on both sides. Mentions of Freikorps firing at innocent civilians accused of being communist have also circulated, but that rumour is yet to be confirmed. For now, the balance of Europe shakes, as a new power may soon preside."
 fgb.25.a: "What a timeline we are living in, huh?"
 fgb.26.t: "The Germans ask for an Anschluss!"
 fgb.26.d: "It is clear that from the moment they united, all eyes were set on Austria: Our strip of territory, populated mostly by Germans, anxious and without jobs, seeking to join a much more prosperous and wealthy Germany where their Government will treat them right. But we are their Government, not the German's, so, do we concede to this proposal?"
 fgb.26.a: "Yes! It is in our peoople's best interest"
 fgb.26.b: "No, but we will join their faction instead..."
 fgb.27.t: "The Austrians reject, but join the Pakt!"
 fgb.27.d: "While not a full Anschluss or economic integration, a compromise has been reached; The Austrians have allowed themselves to join the faction under the condition that the movement of Austrian Peoples, and their safety, is guaranteed, so that Austrians who have jobs in Bavaria can reach them without passing a border checkpoint."
 fgb.27.a: "Not the worst news to hear..."
 fgb.28.t: "Our control has centralised!"
 fgb.28.d: "We have done it, Germany is finally secured and any threat made against us has, in some way, been eliminated. People respect us, they love us, and many of them could actually elect us again, a comfortable phrase to hear when you're a democracy."

The Kapp Putsch was an attempt, supported by the DVLP and its allies, to overthrow the German Republic after its failures to supress the Spartacist uprising which has spread to its east. As a result, much of its Prussian territory has been divided by foreign powers seeking to gain more territory and influence, and has been a source of anger and vengeance for the Freikorps ever since.

It is an economic policy that consits of nationalisation of essential goods and resources, but privatisation of the economy, in a controlled and sustained manner, so that the German economy can grow freely, but if it were ever to collapse, there would be precautions to avoid the worst effects.

 fgb.86.d: "A large warehouse, with a significant number of various still-functioning weapons and devices, has been uncovered near the town of Konstanz in the south, by a small group of wanderers. The facility seemed to be empty and abandoned, but records found in its office has revealed that there has been a significant amount of activity within it over the past few days, with multiple figures involved in the case. Who has perpretrated this mystery is unknown, and the source of the guns is also unclear, however, many soldiers have taken the opportunity to 'seize' the smuggled firearms for their own uses, and it is probably best to do so in case if this is somehow related to the numerous gangs operating in the area."
 fgb.86.a: "Not something you'd want to find in a gazette, keep it hidden!"
 fgb.87.t: "Discontent amongst the Army"
 fgb.87.d: "Noske's recent public statements regarding his goals towards a transition to a democracy in the future has raised a few feathers, particularly many of those of our Army branch. Our most ranked Marshal, Walther Freiherr von Lüttwitz, is the primary culprit of this complaint, and has recently been observed organising private meetings between several high ranking members not too unlike himself. \n\nMany other groups have also taken interest, including Der Stahlhelm, albeit they are the least of our worries at the moment."
 fgb.87.a: "What is he planning?"
 fgb.88.t: "Freiherr von Lüttwitz mounts a Coup!"
 fgb.88.d: "The conspiracy has concluded. Lüttwitz wants nothing but for an Authoritarian, Military-oriented government to stay in control and for him to be at its helm, as such, he and his closest men has taken to the streets of Stuttgart to attempt a Coup d'état against Noske's transitional regime, arguing that his selection was based on an unfair evaluation of the State's condition, and that his policies will subsequently bring an end to the entire Freikorps."
 fgb.88.a: "With the support of the Generals, his Coup succeeds!"
 fgb.88.b: "His plans fall flat as he fails to march on the Town Hall in time"
 fgb.89.t: "Bloodless coup in the Freikorps"
 fgb.89.d: "On this day, the limited news received from the territories forming the Freikorps, have told of us of a recent Coup d'état that happened in Stuttgart. The leader, Gustav Noske, has been deposed in favour of a more autocratic regime ruled by the Field Marshal Walther Freiherr von Lüttwitz, a man deemed by many to be even more repressive than the late Wolfgang Kapp. The fate of what Germany will be has dramatically shifted, and the future is all but certain for whats to come."
 fgb.89.a: "Just warlords bickering amongst each other"
 fgb.90.t: "Fate of Mr. Noske"
 fgb.90.d: "After our recent Coup, the main target, Gustav Noske, has been captured, very soon after we took hold of the Stuttgart town hall. At the moment, he is imprisoned, at a local police station, but he is still yet to receive a trial or process that will decide what to do with him."
 fgb.90.a: "He was fine for the ~20 days we had him"
 FGB_gustav_noske_will_spend_his_last_days_tt:0 "§OGustav Noske will be imprisoned for life at a secretive location, with no input as to what happened to him towards the Press, apart from a lie that he was supposedly exiled to Switzerland.§!"
 fgb.91.t: "A Precedent has been set!"
 fgb.91.d: "Our recent Coup, which many look on favourably, others not much so, has raised the attention of many opposing groups, such as the forementioned Der Stahlhelm, who aims to crack their own shot at leadership. The Freikorps is currently divided among those who support them, and those who are loyal to our own cause"
 fgb.91.a: "What?!"
 fgb.92.t: "Hans Vogel demands immediate return of power"
 fgb.92.d: "The SPD journalist and politician from Franconia, and a close ally to Gustav Noske, has demanded our instantaneous transition back towards the liberalisation process, and for him to be under his governance. He argues that many people abide by this, in particular, the anti-junkers peasantry, and the working class who had been harshly affected by our recent past actions."
 fgb.92.a: "In your dreams bud"
 fgb.92.b: "His soft coup succeeds, unfortunately"
 FGB_choose_this_to_go_back_to_noske:0 "§OChoosing this option will lead you back towards the path to democracy in the Noske branch, but you will have less support to do so.§!"
 fgb.93.t: "Freikorps Counter-coup"
 fgb.93.d: "The SPD politician, Hans Vogel, has taken up arms and the hearts of the People, to march upon Stuttgart, like Freiherr before him, to take away his power for his own, and to re-establish a liberal democracy like how Gustav Noske has yearned to achieve."
 fgb.93.a: "This is getting ridiculous"
 fgb.94.t: "Der Stahlhelm mobilises its forces"
 fgb.94.d: "Our adversary and rival, Der Stahlhelm, a paramilitary group not too much unlike our own, has began re-mobilising its loyal units and recalling all officials to their centres of control in Baden. It is currently unknown what they are going to do, but many members within the Council are speculating that they are about to launch a Coup or an Uprising against us!"
 fgb.94.a: "They're not going to coup us, surely?"
 fgb.95.t: "Der Stalhelm attempt a Coup!"
 fgb.95.d: "It has happened again; a civil war. Not between different factions with opposing ideologies, but against a group that we have fought together with for the defense of our authoritarian ideals. Alas, it was never set to last. Internal disagreements about how unification will be brought about as well as how to rule Germany after it had been unified had led us to this moment. Man against man, Brother against Brother, in an unnecessary war."
 fgb.95.a: "They're not going to go off easily"
 fgb.95.b: "Our loyalties lie elsewhere"
 fgb.96.t: "A Close Circle"
 fgb.96.d: "Our armies are composed of multiple officers and commanders, but only a quaint few are loyal enough to follow our true intentions. We should tie in these folks to higher positions, incentivise absolute party and military loyalty, and rid the forces of any dissidence. It is a necessary step to achieve, and ensure, complete operational efficiency."
 fgb.96.a: "There is no one over the Führer..."
 fgb.97.t: "Fate of Lüttwitz"
 fgb.97.d: "After Gustav Noske's brash release, he has developed a series of plans designed to thin out the Freikorps of any more possible dissidence, involving the trial and imprisonment of the Freikorpsführer, Walther Freiherr von Lüttwitz. Despite the trial being conducted on a fair process, with a relatively impartial Jury, his fate would already have been decided before he even entered the courtroom; He has been sentenced to a life behind bars, in a secretive location, not unlike Noske, but this time concealed by its rurality and forests. Nobody will know where we hid him, not even much of us."
 fgb.97.a: "He got roasted into oblivion, literally, where is he?"
 fgb.98.t: "Student's protests erupt near Pforzheim!"
 fgb.98.d: "As a part of the ongoing trend of much of the working class revolting or rebelling against the central Government, there have been reports of entire schools being shut down in cities such as Pforzheim as a result of students refusing to cooperate over harsh working rules and general unfair treatment, perpetrated by low local funding and wartime mandates. We must do something at once!"
 fgb.98.a: "Give the kids a good incentive to step down"
 FGB_student_protests:0 "Student Protests"
 fgb.99.t: "Purging the old Administration"
 fgb.99.d: "Our previous selection of ministers during the era of the DVLP was not the best. There was bound to be the occasional bureaucratic slop or acts that simply couldn't be passed. But those days are over, now. With only one central figurehead at it all, Walther Freiherr will deliver a more efficient (and effective) administration that will take its policies and matters more seriously, and ensure that no such trouble such as the Stahlhelm revolt will happen ever again. With the close eye of many of our best men, the forces holding the southern reactionary vanguard will become strengthened and emboldened to the best of their capabilites."
 fgb.99.a: "New faces are always welcome!"
 fgb.100.t: "The Darkness Subsides"
 fgb.100.d: "Today, Freiherr Luttwitz stood in the central plaza of the Altstadt in Stuttgart this morning, to commemorate the end of Austerity, a return to normalcy, and an expected return to ernstwhile stability. Many have hoped that he would deliver the news of a possible election, but no such information has been given. Nonetheless, many still responded with rejoice, and the speech overall received a fairly positive national response."
 fgb.100.a: "We've dealt with one adversary, we'll deal with the rest!"
 fgb.101.t: "Sturmabteilung Takeover in the Freikorps"
 fgb.101.d: "Today, the paramilitary force of the Freikorps, in control of much of Southern Germany, has announced its dissolution and integration into the Nationalist Sturmabteilung. This comes after a long period of purges and political reform that essentially made the Freikorps be unable to resist such a decision. The balance of power in Europe is now under threat, as another Nationalist force enters the ring to decide the destiny of Germany."
 fgb.101.a: "Will the Stormtroopers be able to aim this time?"
 fgb.102.t: "Consolidating Our Power"
 fgb.102.d: "The Freikorps is no more, everyone is by our side, regardless if they want to be or not. We now have free reign to implement our own policies independent of the Freikorps council."
 fgb.102.a: "Let us see our next path"
 fgb.103.t: "Duesterberg offer his services"
 fgb.103.d: "The famous Stahlhelm member, and a known Nationalist, Theodor Duesterberg, has approached our government to plea for mercy and a possible role in the unification of Germany. He is offering his skills as a well-minded, wise Field Marshal that we could use to our advantage. If we accept the offer, it might increase Stahlhelm support in the countryside, but if hes under our boot, there will be no such thing."
 fgb.103.a: "We could use a Field Marshal..."
 fgb.103.b: "No! Don't let the Stahlhelm get any political edge!"
 fgb.104.t: "Sturmabteilung troops demand our immediate annexation!"
 fgb.104.d: "The Nationalist Socialist state that is the Sturmabteilung has appraoched our council with a series of demands, with how we have read it, it seems that the outcome will be the same no matter if we accept it or not. If we do, our state will be inadvertedly annexed into the powerbase under Rohm, but if we refuse, we face the same fate as if we had accepted, immediate annexation. Though we're weaker than them, we could easily hold out for possibly months on end, and as a result, stall the Sturmabteilung enough for another party to take interest, and then we could hit them with a counterattack, that's the plan at least."
 fgb.104.a: "We're cornered, its joever..."
 fgb.104.b: "Why should we be afraid? Men, arm yourselves!"
 fgb.105.t: "The Sturmabteilung Socialists offer peaceful Reunification!"
 fgb.105.a: "Isn't national bolshevism the same as national socialism anyway?"
 fgb.105.b: "No! We will not allow these false socialists to infilitrate our ranks!"
 fgb.106.t: "The Freikorps offer peaceful Reunification..."
 fgb.106.a: "It is a fool's choice to reject an offer to join a regime not too unlike ours"
 fgb.106.b: "We will fight to the bitter end for the land we have claimed."
 fgb.107.t: "The Freikorps attempt a coup attempt in Munich!"
 fgb.108.t: "Our coup is successful!"
 fgb.109.t: "Freikorps coup in Bavaria"
 fgb.109.d: "No gunshots are heard, but at the heartland of socialism in Southern Germany, in the cities of Munich and Regensburg, local governors have been deposed and replaced with Freikorps sympathisers. The fate of the Bavarian council is not known, as most of the members have fled nearly all of the major cities, but the reality is certain; Bavaria is no longer communist; The Soviet dream is dead."
 fgb.109.a: "Marx is tumbling in his grave"
 fgb.110.t: "Bavaria rejects our demands!"
 fgb.110.a: "Gear up boys..."
 fgb.111.t: "Our allies in the South offer us Reunification"
 fgb.111.d: "The Sturmabteilung, a socialist albeit nationalist force that is not too unlike ourselves, has offered us a peaceful and bloodless reunification, offering many of our officers high positions and letting us govern our own areas with no trouble, as if nothing would change. The simple matter of conflict is their syndicalist stance on Welfare and the economy, which is indeed a source for debate. So, what should our answer be to this proposal?"
 fgb.111.a: "We, as brothers, are stronger fighting together!"
 fgb.111.b: "We will not sign off our sovereignity to glorified marxists."
 fgb.112.t: "Marching Further North"
 fgb.112.d: "Today is the day that we shall not only retake the Weser and the Ems, but the north sea coast that lines their shores. At last, our admirals will be able to command a new fleet, and we will be able to build up a fleet capable of rivalling that of the Spartacists or the Republicans."
 fgb.112.a: "As they used to say; Freikorps Voran!"
 fgb.113.t: "The Sturmabteilung sends their demands"
 fgb.113.d: "As far as we are concerned, the socialist nationalist Sturmabteilung has just asked us our immediate terms of surrender to their Government. Of course, this is unnaceptable by all means, but surrender in this case could potentially save more lives than it could do otherwise. After all, we strive to serve in the interest of all of our people, and what kind of government would we be if we sent the unwilling onto the front?"
 fgb.113.a: "We're going to accept these terms if it means the public is safe"
 fgb.113.b: "We're not capitalists, but even selflessness can not protect us"
 fgb.114.t: "A New Coat Of Paint"
 fgb.114.d: "From how far we've come, many people in our council are arguing that we should transition to more of a model government, ready for a more fulfilled reunification, so that when the time comes, we have the necessary institutions that would make integration easier. However, others also argue that imagery is key, and that going by a unique militaristic identity would improve our outlook. What does the Führer choose?"
 fgb.114.a: "To forge a new Reich is to have a new Germany"
 fgb.114.b: "There is no need, the red flag will be kept"
 fgb.115.t: "Premature Celebrations"
 fgb.115.d: "While we have not fully unified Germany, we have unified it to a point where we can be comfortable with initiating Celebrations across the country. The remainder of the German states no longer pose a threat against our government as they are either controlled by inconsequential warlords or are occupied by foreign powers."
 fgb.115.a: "Prost, for now"
 fgb.116.t: "Röhm's speech about the party"
 fgb.116.d: "My German Brothers! We stand in front of a new age for our nation! Our fatherland has been betrayed and robbed of its glory on the world stage. Our people have been living under conditions worse than those hundreds of years ago. But these times are coming to an end! The Sturmabteilung has returned Germany's dignity at last. Many brave men of the SA have died fighting for a new future for our children. Yet still we face something worse than enemies: traitors. Our institutions have been infiltrated by those who support the Judeobolshevik agenda to make Germany into a puppet regime of the global elites. We will never let this happen. §RHITLER, HIMMLER, BORMANN! WE ARE COMING FOR YOU! HITLER THE JEW WILL PERISH TOGETHER WITH HIS DEGENERATE BAND. LONG LIVE THE FATHERLAND. WOE TO ALL TRAITORS. THE GERMAN JUDAS MUST DIE.§!"
 fgb.116.a: "Pray tell"
 fgb.117.t: "Röhm announces The Great Purge"
 fgb.117.d: "That's right. Röhm's recent speech concluded in him immediately rolling out orders to detain and arrest many particular individuals, such as early party members Bormann and Hess, as well as others which he deemed a threat to the security to the Regime. Some have compared his actions to a book of fiction, titled 'Kristallnacht', which describes an event where an overmighty militia leader eventually gets both himself and the people around him executed by the head of state. Others initially called Röhm's bluff, after all, he is getting a bit insane, but were completely shocked when the orders eventually came through. The party committe is drafting a response to this strange episode."
 fgb.117.a: "Oh, this is definitely on the bingo card!"
 fgb.118.t: "The Party Committe opposes Röhm's recent actions"
 fgb.118.d: "The Party Committe of the SDAP, an otherwise irrelevant body of governance, has collectively unleashed their disapproval of Röhm's brash actions, specifically around his recent treatment of valued party members and figures. While the party is de-jure governed by Röhm himself, many higher ups have formed factions opposing him, many siding with the nationalist wing, the NDAP, to garner more support. With a divided party and generals on the brink of revolt, how does Röhm handle this news?"
 fgb.118.a: "Röhm presses on!"
 fgb.118.b: "Röhm resigns as party leader, instead giving it to Drexler"
 fgb.119.t: "The Gay Röhm Conspiracy"
 fgb.119.d: "Recent documents have been leaked across party circles which reveal Röhm's personal past and details about his sexuality, arguing that he is rather... flamboyant, and heavily deviates from the heterosexual way of life at times. This is terrible news if it is leaked to the press, as it will deteriorate the party's view as a leading institution of a pure German state."
 fgb.119.a: "Burn them."
 fgb.120.t: "The Tension Breaches"
 fgb.120.d: "Is it truly over? The western portions of the Reich have splitten away to form their own government separate from our own, headed by a mainly fringe far-right coalition of generals and politicians that did not encapsulate our interest. The most notable of those is the Thule society, which its' party emblem has become their offical flag. How do we overcome this threat? It is for the future to decide."

 WORLDNEWS.15.t: "ERNST RÖHM UNITES GERMANY"
 WORLDNEWS.15.d: "The German lands, as of recent times, have found themselves under the control of the Sturmabteilung paramilitary, and thus under the command of its leader Ernst Röhm. However, it was not until very recently that the Führer declared complete unification of the Reich, cementing his grip and allowing Germany to be once again ruled by a right-wing Military dictatorship, albeit the current Government has no desire for reinstating monarchs. The new nation is governed by the SDAP, a splinter group of the DAP and an economically socialist far-right party, whose members have been banned in several states. What the Führer will do is anyone's best guess, but nearly everyone agrees that he isn't stopping at Breslau."
 WORLDNEWS.15.a: "No more war, no more communists I see"
 WORLDNEWS.17.t: "ANTON DREXLER UNITES GERMANY"
 WORLDNEWS.17.d: "Anton Drexler, one of the many founders of the original DAP, has proclaimed in Berlin the complete reunification of Germany. An outcome of several military campaigns, deals and inter-party backstabbing, the Führer has found himself to be uncontested, both as a German contender and in his own party. Many covert news organisations have reported the absence of many party functionaries, and a seemingly sudden re-organisation of the armed forces. It is not certain what form this new Germany will take on the international stage, but if its anything of malice, it will surprise nobody."

Initially joining the Bavarian pioneers as a volunteer, List quickly impressed with his aptitude for command and was promoted to Lieutenant and attended the Bavarian War Academy. Besides a brief stint in the 1st Bavarian Infantry Regiment, List would immediately shift to staff work, and was an operations planning officer by the start of the Great War. Serving as chief of staff in various divisions, List didn't get his own command until after the war when he made a choice to switch to the mountain troops.\n\nQuickly getting recognised for his skills in training and aptitude for mountain warfare, List was switched to the training department of the Freikorps' Alpine Regiment, where he has served for two years as a valuable asset to the Brigades. As his skills improved, his ranks would rise also, and he came to be known as a Field Marshal by June 1921.§!"
