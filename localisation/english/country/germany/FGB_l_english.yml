 FGB_freikorps_legacy_desc: "For nearly a century we have served, in various ways, to a number of duchies and kingdoms as loose units put under a single name, but now that our name is stuck on the map and we have our own state, what should our servitude extend to?"

 freikorps.1.a: "The future looks bleak"
 
 fgb.1.t: "The Matter of Army Reform"
 fgb.1.d: "Several generals have come to the command to tell us a variety of ideas, and there seems to have formed 2 distinct general ideas as to how the Army Reform may go about. The first camp argues that a quick offensive is necessary to avoid the horrors that were bourne in the depths of the nasty gas-filled trenches, while the other insinuates that careful planning, combined with better logistics, is far more superior, as such a frontline can keep moving and delay or suspend the need for trenche warfare entirely. The Command concludes with..."

 FGB_consequences_of_the_great_war_desc: "The Great War was a disaster for us all. Trade has essentially been truffled into meaningless smuggling perpetrated by the various criminal organisations that run in our countryside. The factories are too big for how little they produce. The people are exhausted, the hospitals full, and the trauma endures like a thundercloud above everyone's head. If we are to ever progress, we must tread carefully to do so, otherwise the consequences may be dire..."
