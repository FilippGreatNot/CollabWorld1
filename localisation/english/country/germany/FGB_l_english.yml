 fgb.1.t: "The Matter of Army Reform"
 fgb.1.d: "Several generals have come to the command to tell us a variety of ideas, and there seems to have formed 2 distinct general ideas as to how the Army Reform may go about. The first camp argues that a quick offensive is necessary to avoid the horrors that were bourne in the depths of the nasty gas-filled trenches, while the other insinuates that careful planning, combined with better logistics, is far more superior, as such a frontline can keep moving and delay or suspend the need for trenche warfare entirely. The Command concludes with..."

 fgb.4.t: "The Freikorps Captures Bavaria"
 fgb.4.d: "Germany is in shock as the streets of Munich are filled with marching soldiers of the nationalist Freikorps. Last evening, the troops assumed full control of the city and the Bavarian Socialists declared their capitulation. This marks a shift in the German civil war as factions begin to usurp one another to take Germany for themselves. The local corporal stated that the city has been totally cleansed from the bolshevik disease. Our own reports are confirming this, as many houses of old socialists have been burnt to the ground. Many soldiers were also hanged, which brought criticism to the Freikorps from the international community."
 fgb.4.a: "A Major Shift"

 fgb.5.t: "Victory over the Bavarians"

 fgb.6.t: "Fate of the Soviet Council"
 fgb.6.d: "Eugene Levine and his goons have finally been captured and put in our prisons, now its just the time to decide what to do with them. \n\nIt is obvious that we can't begin a fair trial, not when our courts are already filled with thousands of other worthless communists, and under our anti-communist leadership, we don't see why we have to. \n\nThe verdict is obvious; There is only one thing to do."
 fgb.6.a: "Execute them"

 fgb.7.t: "Moving our offices"
 fgb.7.d: "We have decided to move our offices to the bavarian capital and historic center of Munich, while it may be unpopular to some, especially those still weary about our takeover, the upper leadership in fact praises this change. \n\nSeveral reporters have commented that the freikorps is getting a rise in legitimacy, and that it won't be long before we start establishing official relationships with other countries."

 fgb.8.t: "Hitler offers his services"
 fgb.8.d: "A young soldier has approached the council, with a clear condescending voice and the passion with the power of a bull, he has offered to take up a vacant position within our ranks to improve the policy against the marxists, the one thing is, some have revealed that he has links to a number of nationalistic and occultist organisations, but rohm, a friend of his, and one of our own, has argued that these sentiments are indifferent to ours, seeing as we have defeated a communist foe and are against any proponent who dares to align with them. \n\nOne final question that needs to be answered is, should we let him in?"

 fgb.10.d: "The Free German Brigades, better known as Freikorps, have today declared the so called Wiedervereinigung of Germany to be complete. Freikorps flags were raised in Berlin while a march was also held to show the power of the brigades and project power regionally. This marks a major change in the world as Germany will now once again play a big role in global geopolitics. What the new government will do remains uncertain, but either way it will certainly have effects on Europe as a whole. \n\n§bFreikorps Voran!§!"

 fgb.11.b: "... But to prepare first before fighting."

 fgb.12.t: "The Issue of Women's Suffrage"
 fgb.12.d: "One of our planned policies is to allow women a chance to vote; For far too long women have been disenfranchised and oppressed by an authoritarian and mainly partiarchical series of governments, but now under our administration they have a chance to break that line. \n\nThe question is, how should we go about implementing this policy?"

 fgb.13.d: "At 18:08, this very evening, Freikorps troops have broken through the seige that occurred at the city gates of Essen and captured the Wehrkommando Dusseldorf's Capital Building, along with capturing a variety of other critical cities. As the Wehrkommando's army got overwhelmed, the government was forced to sign a peace deal, signing off their entire territory to the undeterred Freikorps' Administration. The future bodes well with the Freikorps, but the question remains..."

 fgb.15.d: "We have captured the fabled man, the ultranationalist himself, Heinrich Himmler, word has spread that the driver that drove the wagon to get here has gotten ailed off an unidentified illness, some even have pointed out that a revolting stench has seemed to pour out of the car once the doors have been opened. \n\nThe situation at hand is not about that incident, however, and it is instead what to do with this mythical devil. Many have argued to let him be, and perhaps join the Freikorps one day as a central member, but his attitudes, combined with his extremist desires, have got him reminding us more of Kapp and Ludendorff than anything else, as if they even wished to be compared to him."
 fgb.15.a: "He shall spend his final days rotting in hell, where he belongs."

 fgb.16.t: "The recapture of the region of Eupen"
 fgb.16.d: "Our troops have marched through the crudely constructed city walls and have conquered the towns of Eupen and Spa. With the help of the local populace, a local governorate has been established allowing for us to peaceful annex and integrate the region thereafter. The reponse from the opposition government has led us to silence, as no other soldiers have been spotted marching into the area, and only the local garrisons seemed to have resisted. We take this as a sign that the government at hand is either distracted or gives little care in our shenanigans in the area."
 fgb.16.a: "One more region to our vaterland..."

 fgb.21.c: "Let us not disatisfy the People, the Conservatives will win!!"

 fgb.22.t: "Election Day!"
 fgb.22.d: "Thank you all for gathering here today, we are proud of announcing our first general election, the first in the Reich, the first in a United Germany, it is a luxury that you are all seated here to experience this moment in time, a fine bookmark in History. With full confidence, I can say that each eligible citizen has now submitted their ballots and the election results are due to arrive shortly, to be represented onto this screen here. \n\nAny questions?"
 fgb.22.a: "May the best man win!"

 fgb.23.t: "No party secures a Majority!"
 fgb.23.d: "Unfortunately, the results of the recent election have proven that the country is still divided, although politically, and that all major coalitions have not managed to gain objective majorities in the provisional parliament. It is sad to see, but we can always govern under a minority government and try to gain support later on, perhaps a party might gain the majorty?"
 fgb.23.a: "What?!"

 fgb.24.t: "The Kleindeutsche Idea"
 fgb.24.d: "The 'Kleindeutsche' is an idea labelled by many historians and experts to refer to the current national situation concerning the status of Germany and Austria. It originated in the 19th century, during Germany's reunification under prussia, where Austria, a country with a substantial German/German-speaking population, was never convened to join. Today, as it stands, as how we are united once again after the Great War and how Austria has been reduced to mainly it's German-speaking parts, the issue has come about again, what we should ask is, should this separation remain?"
 fgb.24.a: "We will petition the Austrian Parliament"

 fgb.25.t: "The Freikorps Storm Berlin!"
 fgb.25.d: "A famous photo has been captured of the Brandenburg gate; 9,000 Freikorps troops, waving their flags, cheering on, while civilians gather all around. This wasn't a photoshoot, it occured today at 15:08 at the Afternoon. The Freikorps have finally returned to the old capital after an exhausting battle, with tens of thousands of affected on both sides. Mentions of Freikorps firing at innocent civilians accused of being communist have also circulated, but that rumour is yet to be confirmed. For now, the balance of Europe shakes, as a new power may soon preside."
 fgb.25.a: "What a timeline we are living in, huh?"

 fgb.26.t: "The Germans ask for an Anschluss!"
 fgb.26.d: "It is clear that from the moment they united, all eyes were set on Austria: Our strip of territory, populated mostly by Germans, anxious and without jobs, seeking to join a much more prosperous and wealthy Germany where their Government will treat them right. But we are their Government, not the German's, so, do we concede to this proposal?"
 fgb.26.a: "Yes! It is in our peoople's best interest"
 fgb.26.b: "No, but we will join their faction instead..."
 
 fgb.27.t: "The Austrians reject, but join the Pakt!"
 fgb.27.d: "While not a full Anschluss or economic integration, a compromise has been reached; The Austrians have allowed themselves to join the faction under the condition that the movement of Austrian Peoples, and their safety, is guaranteed, so that Austrians who have jobs in Bavaria can reach them without passing a border checkpoint."
 fgb.27.a: "Not the worst news to hear..."

 fgb.28.t: "Our control has centralised!"
 fgb.28.d: "We have done it, Germany is finally secured and any threat made against us has, in some way, been eliminated. People respect us, they love us, and many of them could actually elect us again, a comfortable phrase to hear when you're a democracy."
 fgb.28.a: "Doing better than the Brits I see..."
 
 fgb.29.t: "The Vaterland, United!"
 fgb.29.d: "We have finally united Germany, now it is only the time to integrate our states, begin a process of mild demobilisation, and show Europa our worth. If we wish to make an impact on history, it is best if we centralise our position, and eliminate radical elements, to prevent an overthrow or a couping of the Government, like how the Weimar republic had gone through before us."
 fgb.29.a: "Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?"
 
 fgb.30.t: "Effects of Reunification"
 fgb.30.d: "Our unification came with not only territorial gains, but also inclusion of various peoples and factions that wish to oppose us, as well as a sudden economic crisis brought about by our overburdened administration and a critically overstretched industry and economic code. Since we have adapted several policies to safeguard against a possible crisis like this, the effects are only mild, but are still a blight on our people and economic growth. It is time to pick up the shovel and repair Germany again!"
 fgb.30.a: "It's as if the Great War never went away..."

 fgb_policy.1.t: "The Demand has been Met!"
 fgb_policy.1.d: "Those weak bastards have succesfully conceded their territory to us!"
 fgb.policy.1.a: "A Piece of the Vaterland has Returned!"
 fgb_policy.2.t: "The Demand has been Rejected!"

Initially joining the Bavarian pioneers as a volunteer, List quickly impressed with his aptitude for command and was promoted to Lieutenant and attended the Bavarian War Academy. Besides a brief stint in the 1st Bavarian Infantry Regiment, List would immediately shift to staff work, and was an operations planning officer by the start of the Great War. Serving as chief of staff in various divisions, List didn't get his own command until after the war when he made a choice to switch to the mountain troops.\n\nQuickly getting recognised for his skills in training and aptitude for mountain warfare, List was switched to the training department of the Freikorps' Alpine Regiment, where he has served for two years as a valuable asset to the Brigades. As his skills improved, his ranks would rise also, and he came to be known as a Field Marshal by June 1921.§!"
