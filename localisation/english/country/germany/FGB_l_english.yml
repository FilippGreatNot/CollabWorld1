 FGB_rerecruitment_drive_desc: "Drop your pens! We are in dire need of new people to add to our army, so we will look towards recruiting former officers and army personnel.

 FGB_tank_innovations: "Armour Innovations"

 ## Noske's Path ##

 FGB_noske: "Gustav Noske"
 FGB_noske_desc: "Mr. Noske has been chosen as the preferred candidate due to his ability to communicate well with the population and several governments abroad, as well as being one of only a few people with some power that aren't entirely within the right-wing political camp."
 FGB_noske_ease_unrest: "Stabilise our cabinet"
 FGB_noske_ease_unrest_desc: "Our cabinet is fraught with ministers from the previous regime, while this is not necessarily bad, and is generally good in terms of governance and experience, many of them have been involved in many counts of corruption and scandals in the past, and it would be very damaging to our new administration if we aren't ever to give them the boot, therefore we shall."
 FGB_noske_allow_moderates: "Never another Januaraufstand"
 FGB_noske_allow_moderates_desc: "The Chaos has made way for a significant rise in popularity of various far-left parties, we, as an inherently nationalist force, cannot led these plebs roam the land. Of course we will treat workers with respect, but rioters, who dare to spit on our hero's portraits, do not deserve such treatment."
 FGB_noske_cooperate_with_democrats: "Over from the north"
 FGB_noske_cooperate_with_democrats_desc: "Many elements of the Freikorps are composed of formerly republican or defecting reichswehr units, and it wouldn't be unfair to assume that some of them hold to their Republican or Liberal values, we will use this to our advantage to help them reduce the amount of violence that dominates our cities by instituting them as local Governors, on the upper level, and as enforcers of the law, on the lower level."
 FGB_noske_womens_suffrage: "Befreit die Frauen"
 FGB_noske_womens_suffrage_desc: "It is time we tackle the ever-recurring problem that are women's rights. Women contribute a greater than ever portion of the population, putting them as a majority, and them not being able to vote is quite hypocritical if we are ever to establish a democratic system of governance, thus, we will pass the first laws that will enfranchise, and give amnesty to those who were affected by past repressions."
 FGB_noske_separation_of_church_and_state: "Kultusfreiheit"
 FGB_noske_separation_of_church_and_state_desc: "Despite being a majority-catholic region, many countries around us have implemented secular policies, barring educational institutions and other public services from mandating the teachings of christianity. We shall follow in their footsteps and implement our own secular policies regarding this topic."
 FGB_noske_freikorps_spd: "A Militant SPD"
 FGB_noske_freikorps_spd_desc: "Enough SPD members have gathered here in Stuttgart to form their own official department of the SPD, to possibly govern and lead the future of the lands occupied by the Freikorps.

 FGB_noske_rejuvenate_old_industries_desc: "Several of once famous production hubs have been badly damaged by our frequent wars, and have lost relevance as the workers have moved away or been conscripted.

 FGB_noske_rub_off_kapp_memory: "Recovering from the Putsch"
 FGB_noske_rub_off_kapp_memory_desc: "It is time to take down the short-lived statues of Kapp, revert the degenerate laws his administration has passed, and limit the powers of his former cabinet to become essentially regular politicians. Many steps will be taken to defeat this evil."
 FGB_noske_allow_local_free_elections: "Allow local free elections"
 FGB_noske_allow_local_free_elections_desc: "We will allow the people to vote who is to be their next regional governor, it is much more fair than picking whichever guy we want in charge, since sometimes they wouldn't even be from the region! But, fortunately, that is about to change..."
 FGB_noske_allow_local_free_elections_tt:0 "§YUpon picking the focus, you will receive a temporary spirit granting you weekly stability!§!"
 FGB_noske_press_freedom: "Uphold Press Freedom"
 FGB_noske_press_freedom_desc: "Several liberal and democratic newspapers have been oppressed by Kapp's regime, we will allow them to publicate their articles again under the condition that they do not inherently promote the values of our adversaries, and, oh, that they don't do anything... communist."
 FGB_noske_rebuild_mine_towns: "Rebuild Old Mining Towns"
 FGB_noske_rebuild_mine_towns_desc: "There are only so much mines that are concealed within our own territories, and as such we should give extra care to the ones we have. There are several towns with once prominent mining communities that we have the responsibility to revive."
 FGB_noske_home_arms_act: "Home Arms Act"
 FGB_noske_home_arms_act_desc: "The right to bear arms, a cornerstone policy for both the swiss and america, is here to get exported to germany. We will allow the people to arm themselves to prepare against any external or foreign threat, and increase preparedness for the military among many of our civillians. Of course we will put precautions in place, and enact strict limits for groups of interest, but from how much of our populace have already served in the war or the army, this should be indifferent to them!"
 FGB_noske_broker_a_peace_with_the_protestors: "Broker a peace with the protestors"
 FGB_noske_broker_a_peace_with_the_protestors_desc: "We will begin to have peace talks with the worker's and student's unions that have organised the protests, in an attempt to calm them down.

 FGB_noske_new_day_new_germany: "§8A New German Dawn§!"
 FGB_noske_new_day_new_germany_desc: "What is stopping us from greatness? Our own limits of course! We should look across our borders for a chance to expand our influence and bring much needed democratic reform to every German region we come by."

 FGB_noske_deagrarianise_bavaria: "De-agrarianise the east"
 FGB_noske_deagrarianise_bavaria_desc: "Ever since the bavarian soviets were proclaimed, the governments inside them have set on numerous policies advising against industrialisation and to focus more on self-sustainability and domestic agriculture, while the new farms are welcome, we do not need so many. As such we will begin a process of converting several factories back into working order and to train the new (or rather old) staff that will work in them."
 FGB_noske_raid_communist_barracks: "Raid Communist Barracks"
 FGB_noske_raid_communist_barracks_desc: "With our unexpected invasion, the bavarians have left plenty of guns lying around in their military posts, we will gather as much as we can to help arm ourselves before the rebels find them."

 FGB_noske_fate_of_communist_leadership_desc: "Eugene, captured, the council, all arrested, and now its time to do what needs to be done. The ideals the government has does not deem the outcome of this process good for the communists."
 FGB_noske_make_munich_capital: "Transfer offices to Munich"
 FGB_noske_make_munich_capital_desc: "Munich is a much larger city with a more defined history, perhaps it would better our legitimacy if we moved our legislative and administrative offices there, after all, Munich is a melting pot of various nationalist factions, in spite of the communist occupation."
 FGB_noske_consolidate_bavaria: "Consolidate our Control"
 FGB_noske_consolidate_bavaria_desc: "We will move significant administrative offices to our own centralised powerbase where the communists will have a tougher time getting to.

 FGB_noske_recruit_new_staff_desc: "The communist regime has arrested those who had any nationalistic or anti-communist sentiments, we will release them from their unjust confinements and encourage those in hiding to return.

 FGB_attack_wehrkommando_desc: "Hesse has once been home to the Freikorps that was stationed there, however, ever since the wehrkommando has consolidated the region, contact between our network and the office there have been severly limited, and the wehrkommando is not allowing much to pass.

 FGB_noske_envelop_local_spd: "Envelop Local SPD Elements"
 FGB_noske_envelop_local_spd_desc: "To ensure the continued stability and security of our nation in its current position, it is crucial that we integrate the local SPD elements into our broader political framework and ideas. This process involves a thorough engagement with local SPD members and their perspectives, aligning their regional priorities with our national objectives. By embracing their input and incorporating their insights into our policies, we can foster a more inclusive and cohesive political environment. This integration will not only strengthen our national unity but also enhance our ability to address local concerns effectively, thereby reinforcing our overall political stability and securing our nation's standing in the present choatic landscape of the 1920's."
 FGB_noske_develop_the_rhine: "Reconstruct the Rhine"
 FGB_noske_develop_the_rhine_desc: "The Rhineland is a historic center of industry and prosperity, and now its ours.

We will provide employment benefits and grant funds for existing factories to expand."
 FGB_noske_liberalise_the_people: "Liberalise the People"
 FGB_noske_liberalise_the_people_desc: "Close to france, it is no wonder many have adopted francophone identites, especially in areas such as the Palatinate and the Saarland. It is for that reason that many there were participating in the Spring of Nations, and thus were subject to spreading or consuming many liberal ideals. We will attempt to bring back this fervor into the Rhineland by manipulating our ideology as being comparable to theirs."
 FGB_noske_power_to_political_minorities: "Power over to the Political Minorities"
 FGB_noske_power_to_political_minorities_desc: "The Rhineland was never truly connected towards the Prussian nation - They have their own regional identities and cultures roughly encompassing the area, and as such we will enable local parties to participate in local elections, as well as support more regional identities overall.

 FGB_noske_pacify_local_militias: "Pacify Regional Militias"
 FGB_noske_pacify_local_militias_desc: "There still remains much of the resistance against our Government, perpetrated by former elements of the Wehrkommando. This is inacceptable in our eyes.

 FGB_noske_amnesty_to_generals: "Amnesty to the Generals"
 FGB_noske_amnesty_to_generals_desc: "During the war, many conscripts were called on to fight, and many fought bravely. These people were often awarded for their actions and by the end of it had found themselves to maintain high-ranking roles, such as those of a General. The Generals of the Wehrkommando are just like those latter men, servants of a regime in wars they do not wish to fight or do not wish to support, but forced in the face of threats and complete suspension. We will attempt to reconcile much of Düsseldorf's former staff, especially those who had links with the Freikorps before."
 FGB_noske_exile_the_kaiser: "Exile the Kaiser"
 FGB_noske_exile_the_kaiser_desc: "The Kaiser is a major symbol for those still left resisting. We will treat them right by Exiling their hero to the Netherlands, who would be glad to meet him. We will recycle our actions into views of supporting the monarchy, but alas removing the Monarch that caused the country's problems, and thus having no real basis for a full resurrection of the Hohenzollern dynasty."

 fgb.1.t: "The Matter of Army Reform"
 fgb.1.d: "Several generals have come to the command to tell us a variety of ideas, and there seems to have formed 2 distinct general ideas as to how the Army Reform may go about. The first camp argues that a quick offensive is necessary to avoid the horrors that were bourne in the depths of the nasty gas-filled trenches, while the other insinuates that careful planning, combined with better logistics, is far more superior, as such a frontline can keep moving and delay or suspend the need for trenche warfare entirely. The Command concludes with..." 
 fgb.1.a: "The Fast Marching of Troops may win us the Wars!"
 fgb.1.b: "We will let the enemy rot in the trenches they themselves have built!"
 fgb.2.t: "The Successor of Wolfgang"
 fgb.2.d: "The Freikorps command has commenced a meeting amongst the upper estate to decide which leader is the next best fit for the freikorps, there are many candidates, but the most popular ones have been sorted into the choices. The question is though, which one of them did the estate choose?"

 fgb.3.a: "We will take back Munich by force!"
 fgb.3.b: "Let us demand instead..."
 fgb.4.t: "The Freikorps Captures Bavaria"
 fgb.4.d: "Germany is in shock as the streets of Munich are filled with marching soldiers of the nationalist Freikorps. Last evening, the troops assumed full control of the city and the Bavarian Socialists declared their capitulation. This marks a shift in the German civil war as factions begin to usurp one another to take Germany for themselves. The local corporal stated that the city has been totally cleansed from the bolshevik disease. Our own reports are confirming this, as many houses of old socialists have been burnt to the ground. Many soldiers were also hanged, which brought criticism to the Freikorps from the international community."
 fgb.4.a: "A Major Shift"
 fgb.5.t: "Victory over the Bavarians"
 fgb.5.d: "We have succeeded, where it may pose a serious challenge for some, it was a challenge that our forces could easily defeat, and this is only one in a number of victories we shall encouter! \n\"One-by-one, we will defeat any foe that comes across us, if it means that our Vaterland will be whole again\". \n§RSoldaten, Weiter!§!"

 fgb.6.t: "Fate of the Soviet Council"
 fgb.6.d: "Eugene Levine and his goons have finally been captured and put in our prisons, now its just the time to decide what to do with them. \n\nIt is obvious that we can't begin a fair trial, not when our courts are already filled with thousands of other worthless communists, and under our anti-communist leadership, we don't see why we have to. \n\nThe verdict is obvious; There is only one thing to do."
 fgb.6.a: "Execute them"
 fgb.7.t: "Moving our offices"
 fgb.7.d: "We have decided to move our offices to the bavarian capital and historic center of Munich, while it may be unpopular to some, especially those still weary about our takeover, the upper leadership in fact praises this change. \n\nSeveral reporters have commented that the freikorps is getting a rise in legitimacy, and that it won't be long before we start establishing official relationships with other countries."
 fgb.7.a: "Now to start removing all the rubble..."
 fgb.8.t: "Hitler offers his services"
 fgb.8.d: "A young soldier has approached the council, with a clear condescending voice and the passion with the power of a bull, he has offered to take up a vacant position within our ranks to improve the policy against the marxists, the one thing is, some have revealed that he has links to a number of nationalistic and occultist organisations, but rohm, a friend of his, and one of our own, has argued that these sentiments are indifferent to ours, seeing as we have defeated a communist foe and are against any proponent who dares to align with them. \n\nOne final question that needs to be answered is, should we let him in?"
 fgb.8.a: "Sure, we could use an extra helping hand"

 fgb.10.t: "The Freikorps unite Germany!"
 fgb.10.d: "The Free German Brigades, better known as Freikorps, have today declared the so called Wiedervereinigung of Germany to be complete. Freikorps flags were raised in Berlin while a march was also held to show the power of the brigades and project power regionally. This marks a major change in the world as Germany will now once again play a big role in global geopolitics. What the new government will do remains uncertain, but either way it will certainly have effects on Europe as a whole. \n\n§bFreikorps Voran!§!"

 fgb.11.a: "Is to attack them at an instant!"
 fgb.11.b: "... But to prepare first before fighting."
 fgb.12.t: "The Issue of Women's Suffrage"
 fgb.12.d: "One of our planned policies is to allow women a chance to vote; For far too long women have been disenfranchised and oppressed by an authoritarian and mainly partiarchical series of governments, but now under our administration they have a chance to break that line. \n\nThe question is, how should we go about implementing this policy?"
 fgb.12.a: "We will make modest reforms to bring more people in!"
 fgb.12.b: "§5Total equality is the only preferable option!§!"
 fgb.13.t: "The Freikorps storm Essen!"
 fgb.13.d: "At 18:08, this very evening, Freikorps troops have broken through the seige that occurred at the city gates of Essen and captured the Wehrkommando Dusseldorf's Capital Building, along with capturing a variety of other critical cities. As the Wehrkommando's army got overwhelmed, the government was forced to sign a peace deal, signing off their entire territory to the undeterred Freikorps' Administration. The future bodes well with the Freikorps, but the question remains..."

 fgb.14.t: "The Consolidation of the West"
 fgb.14.d: "We have achieved nearly complete control over the entire southwestern half of Germany, as of now there are only 3 factions that could oppose us, 2 of them being worthwhile foes, it is time that we begin planning our attacks carefully. The final few stages of reunification are approaching..."
 fgb.14.a: "We shall unify Germany as our predecessors had done in 1870!"
 FGB_noske_unification_nearly_complete_tt: "The focus tree will be greatly expanded, allowing for more non-linear gameplay."
 fgb.15.t: "Fate of Himmler"
 fgb.15.d: "We have captured the fabled man, the ultranationalist himself, Heinrich Himmler, word has spread that the driver that drove the wagon to get here has gotten ailed off an unidentified illness, some even have pointed out that a revolting stench has seemed to pour out of the car once the doors have been opened. \n\nThe situation at hand is not about that incident, however, and it is instead what to do with this mythical devil. Many have argued to let him be, and perhaps join the Freikorps one day as a central member, but his attitudes, combined with his extremist desires, have got him reminding us more of Kapp and Ludendorff than anything else, as if they even wished to be compared to him."
 fgb.15.a: "He shall spend his final days rotting in hell, where he belongs."
 fgb.16.t: "The recapture of the region of Eupen"
 fgb.16.d: "Our troops have marched through the crudely constructed city walls and have conquered the towns of Eupen and Spa. With the help of the local populace, a local governorate has been established allowing for us to peaceful annex and integrate the region thereafter. The reponse from the opposition government has led us to silence, as no other soldiers have been spotted marching into the area, and only the local garrisons seemed to have resisted. We take this as a sign that the government at hand is either distracted or gives little care in our shenanigans in the area."
 fgb.16.a: "One more region to our vaterland..."
 fgb.17.t: "The Germans demand Eupen!"
 fgb.17.d: "The German minister of foreign affairs has suggested to us that we concede the German-majority region of Eupen-malmedy, the question is, should we give in?"

 fgb.19.a: "Sehr Gut..."
 fgb.20.t: "The Western Government demands our Subjugation!"
 fgb.20.d: "A letter has been sent, from Gustav Noske himself, urging us to concede to the Military's demands and to give up control of Berlin and the surrounding areas, as well as transfer Germany's governorship to them. If we do not give in to these demands, Noske further says, then the Freikorps will threaten us with War..."
 fgb.20.a: "They are our only allies!"
 fgb.20.b: "Let them try to break through the Elbe..."
 fgb.21.t: "Fate of German Democracy"
 fgb.21.d: "Millions of citizens are awaiting their time to vote, women sit excitedly next to their brand new TV screens, while the Men lying in hospital beds tune in to their nearby radio, all to see who will win the next President..."
 fgb.21.a: "Gustav Noske will continue his regime"
 fgb.21.b: "A New Germany, New Government: Pick the liberal!"
 fgb.21.c: "Let us not disatisfy the People, the Conservatives will win!"
 fgb.22.t: "Election Day!"
 fgb.22.d: "Thank you all for gathering here today, we are proud of announcing our first general election, the first in the Reich, the first in a United Germany, it is a luxury that you are all seated here to experience this moment in time, a fine bookmark in History. With full confidence, I can say that each eligible citizen has now submitted their ballots and the election results are due to arrive shortly, to be represented onto this screen here. \n\nAny questions?"
 fgb.22.a: "May the best man win!"
 fgb.23.t: "No party secures a Majority!"
 fgb.23.d: "Unfortunately, the results of the recent election have proven that the country is still divided, although politically, and that all major coalitions have not managed to gain objective majorities in the provisional parliament. It is sad to see, but we can always govern under a minority government and try to gain support later on, perhaps a party might gain the majorty?"
 fgb.23.a: "What?!"
 fgb.24.t: "The Kleindeutsche Idea"
 fgb.24.d: "The 'Kleindeutsche' is an idea labelled by many historians and experts to refer to the current national situation concerning the status of Germany and Austria. It originated in the 19th century, during Germany's reunification under prussia, where Austria, a country with a substantial German/German-speaking population, was never convened to join. Today, as it stands, as how we are united once again after the Great War and how Austria has been reduced to mainly it's German-speaking parts, the issue has come about again, what we should ask is, should this separation remain?"
 fgb.24.a: "We will petition the Austrian Parliament"
 fgb.25.t: "The Freikorps Storm Berlin!"
 fgb.25.d: "A famous photo has been captured of the Brandenburg gate; 9,000 Freikorps troops, waving their flags, cheering on, while civilians gather all around. This wasn't a photoshoot, it occured today at 15:08 at the Afternoon. The Freikorps have finally returned to the old capital after an exhausting battle, with tens of thousands of affected on both sides. Mentions of Freikorps firing at innocent civilians accused of being communist have also circulated, but that rumour is yet to be confirmed. For now, the balance of Europe shakes, as a new power may soon preside."
 fgb.25.a: "What a timeline we are living in, huh?"
 fgb.26.t: "The Germans ask for an Anschluss!"
 fgb.26.d: "It is clear that from the moment they united, all eyes were set on Austria: Our strip of territory, populated mostly by Germans, anxious and without jobs, seeking to join a much more prosperous and wealthy Germany where their Government will treat them right. But we are their Government, not the German's, so, do we concede to this proposal?"
 fgb.26.a: "Yes! It is in our peoople's best interest"
 fgb.26.b: "No, but we will join their faction instead..."
 fgb.27.t: "The Austrians reject, but join the Pakt!"
 fgb.27.d: "While not a full Anschluss or economic integration, a compromise has been reached; The Austrians have allowed themselves to join the faction under the condition that the movement of Austrian Peoples, and their safety, is guaranteed, so that Austrians who have jobs in Bavaria can reach them without passing a border checkpoint."
 fgb.27.a: "Not the worst news to hear..."
 fgb.28.t: "Our control has centralised!"
 fgb.28.d: "We have done it, Germany is finally secured and any threat made against us has, in some way, been eliminated. People respect us, they love us, and many of them could actually elect us again, a comfortable phrase to hear when you're a democracy."
 fgb.28.a: "Doing better than the Brits I see..."
 fgb.29.t: "The Vaterland, United!"
 fgb.29.d: "We have finally united Germany, now it is only the time to integrate our states, begin a process of mild demobilisation, and show Europa our worth. If we wish to make an impact on history, it is best if we centralise our position, and eliminate radical elements, to prevent an overthrow or a couping of the Government, like how the Weimar republic had gone through before us."
 fgb.29.a: "Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?"
 fgb.30.t: "Effects of Reunification"
 fgb.30.d: "Our unification came with not only territorial gains, but also inclusion of various peoples and factions that wish to oppose us, as well as a sudden economic crisis brought about by our overburdened administration and a critically overstretched industry and economic code. Since we have adapted several policies to safeguard against a possible crisis like this, the effects are only mild, but are still a blight on our people and economic growth. It is time to pick up the shovel and repair Germany again!"
 fgb.30.a: "It's as if the Great War never went away..."
 fgb.31.t: "Germany offers us a place in their Alliance"
 fgb.31.d: "Today the Newly-established democratic government in Berlin has pleaded us that we join their newly-created power bloc, going by the name of the 'Europakt', It is a military alliance that would offer us many defensive and mutual benefits, should we accept?"

 fgb.33.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
 fgb.33.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our offer and their candidacy has been evolved into a membership! A member more in our goal to unite all of europe..."
 fgb.33.a: "Our alliance grows..."
 fgb.34.t: "Adenauer's Resurgence"
 fgb.34.d: "As we have recently captured the territories of the Wehrkommando Dusseldorf, several groups, have in turn, found themselves within our borders. While many of the minor groups can be easily dealt with or negotiated with, one group in Particular, the so-called 'Crucifix Coalition', has seen a noticeable rise in popularity, especially among the more conservative elements within our ranks. It's leader, Konrad Adenauer, has officialised its formation under the guise of the CDU, and announced its willingness to participate in Electoral matters."
 fgb.34.a: "And we have no reason to oppose this..."
 fgb.35.t: "The Krauts offer us Protection?!"
 fgb.35.d: "For the first time since the start of the German Revolution, we are seeing a new democratic German Government take up arms and declare their intentions to incorporate our lands into their sphere, while it is not a full annexation, many of our Governmental functions will still be handed over and our Sovereignity lost."
 fgb.35.a: "We must ensure our People's safety at all times"
 fgb.35.b: "We see what they really are; a Rubberstamp for the Freikorps!"
 fgb.36.t: "Fate of the Sparatkist Command"
 fgb.36.d: "While the issue of the Leadership itself has widely resulted in a consensus for execution, there are still many who question the morals and loyalty of the Soldiers who fought on the Communists' side. Were they truly evil men or were they simply loyal patriots wishing to see Germany united again? Or were they just following orders?"

 fgb.37.d: "The hall is loud with several overlapping conversations; Echoes beam all around the room. Some cheers are heard over the exciting prospect of the Economy recovering, This life swiftly dies as the Doors open to reveal a small crowd has gathered outside; A short man, with a sternly trimmed Moustache and sternly-dressed clothes. It is Adolf Hitler, the General. Along with him accompany several of his supporters and companions; Röhm, the Strasser brothers, the General Schreck, just to name a few of the many characters the Audience could observe. They didn't come here to interrupt the conversations, they came here for one distinct purpose; To take over."
 fgb.37.a: "They step into the Building and arrest the governors inside, essentially taking over the Government."

Should we accept or reject this deal?"

 fgb.45.d: "Yesternight has come with a list of occurrances, all ranging from mild to outright frightful. This was the night where the Glockennacht incident took place, a violent event happening all across southern Germany, where far-right agitators, mostly supporters of the hitlerite regime, had took up arms against their Jewish neighbours in response to a suspected Raid on a church by Ashkenazi hooligans, in protest of the recent political supression efforts carried out by the Government and it clamping down on religion.

Is a German Warlord state formed as a result of the Kapp Putsch and it's exodus from the Brandenburg Area, to the Catholic-majority areas in the South, from where they have formed a substantial powerbase and maintained their presence since. The Kapp Putsch was an attempt, supported by the DVLP and its allies, to overthrow the German Republic after its failures to supress the Spartacist uprising which has spread to its east. As a result, much of its Prussian territory has been divided by foreign powers seeking to gain more territory and influence, and has been a source of anger and Vengeance for the Freikorps ever since. It is lead by a council of electors who, in the case of an attempted assassination or another coup, Are there to put a provisional leader in charge and to mitigate the aftereffects. It's Chancellor is Dr. Wolfgang Kapp, the icon of the Putsch, and second-in-command is the Field Marshal Walther Von Lüttwitz, and, while he may not seem to hold a lot of power, is very influential in terms of the Army and what the Freikorps forces do. \n\nWe hope that this little description gave you enough insight, and we hope that you Enjoy!"

 fgb.51.d: "Every since we seceeded from the German Republic, a constant issue has arisen from time to time, and it has come up yet again; What to do with the Royals and the Nobles? The German Republic's laws prohibit the entrace of any Royals from entering high-ranking positions, but our cesession has meant that we are no longer subject to these policies, and it is our own question to answer."

They promise that Korfanty will remain as the governor of Upper Silesia until he is de-elected. If we accept it they might finally leave us alone, but we would give up any of our independence."

 fgb.53.d: "The recent elections have brought a surprising, and yet, predictable result; No single party nor coalition has achieved a majority or significant plurality. The house has been divided. Waning support for social democracy, and a great increase in Nationalist sentiment has brought many to question the validity of Noske's rule, and one of those people was Adolph Hiedler. His recent coup on Monday has resulted in a complete regime change; The vacant presidency has been abolished, and the position of Chancellor has been converted into Führer. The Minorities of Germany are starting to become more and more nervous by the day..."

 fgb.54.t: "Setting up the bill"
 fgb.54.d: "We will send the bill towards the Breslau Government, promising them autonomy in their homeland of Upper Silesia, and allowing German unrest to seize.

Their leadership, still lead mostly by members of the Afrikan Schutstaffel and local German officials, has repeatedly stated that they are willing to rejoin the German Vaterland, if it means that they are safeguarded and their locals given the rights they deserved."

 fgb.58.d: "The German Government, at least a significant portion of it, has asked us to come within their sphere of influence once again, but this time operating as an autonomous colony rather than a territory with simple self-governance. They promise that our leadership will remain as it is, albeit with some politicians swapped with more democratic ones, and that the rights of our minorities will be protected, should we accept?"

 fgb.61.d: "A small strip of land, far from the capital, mainly inhabited by tax evaders and dissidents, is a land that is too claimed by another country, a nation that seeks to unify the people within it with itself; Germany. Their loss in the Great war means nothing if our existence is just as easily threatened as it had before, and, with our weakened economy and exhausted populace, any support for a future war would be astronomically low, should we concede to their demands?"
 fgb.61.a: "If it means more funding for Welfare..."
 fgb.61.b: "Absolutely not! We will not give up land we gained that easily!"
 fgb.62.t: "The Krauts demand Northern Schlesvig!"

 fgb.63.b: "We will respect the outcome of the Plebiscites"
 fgb.64.t: "End of the Brother Wars"
 fgb.64.d: "The conflicts are finally over, families finally reunified, and all of the freikorps centres are finally under our rightful control. Our regime has delivered nought but stability and security throughout the entire nation, and we are on the verge on encapsulating the whole of the German Volk. Now we stand at a crossroads; to continue our efforts or to stand still and become a sleeping giant, growing our economy?"

 fgb.65.d: "The Swabian diplomat, whom was recently released from prison after a  m i n o r  torture session, has recently informed us of a proposal made by the German government, unofficially the freikorps, to purchase their lost colony, Cameroun, from us. It is a very touchy issue as the colony has been under German hands a little bit before the Berlin conference, and as such, German support for such a move is high, so, should we support it as well?"

 fgb.66.t: "Germany offers money for the Cameroons"
 fgb.66.d: "A Small strip of land, recently given to our colony Nigeria but still officially claimed by the administration in Yaounde, lies a question of whether we should return it to German control or not, if we accept, it would relieve our dire financial situation by quite the penny. If we refuse, well, there are no real bonuses to doing so, apart from keeping the status quo."

 fgb.69.t: "Noske leads the Provisional Government"
 fgb.69.d: "In moments of instability, it is always crucial to choose who succeeds a leader, but in this moment, a leader has already been chosen for us - Gustav Noske will deliver the necessary governance within the Council until we are capable of deciding who our leader is going to be."
 fgb.69.a: "That Goshdang Bureaucrat"
 fgb.70.t: "Shocks from Kapp's Death"
 fgb.70.d: "His days were numbered, but nobody plotted it on an actual calendar! The stresses of governing a complex country with a variety of issues and strains had led his rule to be left behind... broken. And now, that people of our cities are learning of his recent death, are both reacting in Anguish, Confusion, Happiness, and in a slight bit of Malice."
 fgb.70.a: "1922 does not feel like a good year"
 fgb.71.t: "Fate of the Fatherland Party"
 fgb.71.d: "Wolfgang Kapp has been the de facto leader ever since its founding, and he has really been the only major member, with others hiding in the background from his iron-fist rule. But now that he has died, and the DVLP's role left into question, it is for us to decide what to do with the institution he has left behind."

 fgb.71.b: "Reform it under Pabst's eyes"
 fgb.71.c: "Do nothing - let it die naturally"
 fgb.72.t: "The Freikorps themselves"
 fgb.72.d: "The Paramilitary force with a history stretching over a hundred years, with dozens of officers and commanders pledging loyalty, it is unlikely that we will go away any time soon. But there are still threats we should overcome, issues we should resolve, problems we should reform for to get rid of, and a multitude of enemies awaiting our imminent destruction. Only the Lord knows if we are ever to escape from these trying times."
 fgb.72.a: "The only thing keeping our state together...."
 fgb.73.t: "Dreams of a Greater Ostafrika"
 fgb.73.d: "It is in the name of our colony, Ostafrika, to control the eastern portion of Afrika, and yet, it doesn't. Why not take the opportunity of a collapsed British, and a possibly collapsing French empires to enforce our own dominion over the fabled continent?"
 fgb.73.a: "Mr. Noske, it will be done!"
 fgb.74.t: "Re-Germanising the names"
 fgb.74.d: "The French colonial government has brought upon a policy of urgent francofication, and yet many resisted this. We will help the people relearn the German tongue once again so that it will remain the Lingua 'Franca'."
 fgb.74.a: "Wilkommen!"
 fgb.75.t: "Fate of the Orient"
 fgb.75.d: "Ever since the Italian's control over the area has receded, local groups have taken the opportunity to gather power and influence and had thus formed their own independent states. There is an ongoing international debate whether these are legitimate governments or simply regional secessionist militias that have taken control over Italian colonial territory. We should attempt to settle this by instating our own actions."

 fgb.76.t: "The Germans offer us a deal"
 fgb.76.d: "For the simple price of mutual military cooperation, the German government has offered us this in return for our east african colonies - A supported campaign into east africa that we do not need to do a lot to get back. Many people in our populace, however, resent the Germans and getting them on our side will be difficult, so which choice do we proceed with?"
 fgb.76.a: "Somaliland shall speak the Italian tongue"
 fgb.76.b: "We will not become a diplomatic puppet"
 fgb.77.t: "Criticism against the Government"
 fgb.77.d: "Seeing the ongoing status of the war against Kenya, many people have rallied against the wishes of the Government to protest its involvement. Despite the state in question not being a sovereign country, recognised by little of the international community, especially after it's conquest of the Buganda, it still strikes an issue within the German hearts to send their men to what they view as 'Unnecessary wars' once again."
 fgb.77.a: "Can't blame them"
 fgb.78.t: "Questions against Noske's ascension"
 fgb.78.d: "Gustav Noske presents an idealised militarised interpretation of Social Democracy, one that eventually concludes in Free elections and, optimally, a democratic model for a unified Germany. However, many protest this, as a liberalisation of their state is not something that a historically authoritarian, and control-centred culture and people would respect. It is one of the several key challenges that the Noske administration must overcome to succeed in its goals."
 fgb.78.a: "(Player) I'll try my best"
 fgb.79.t: "Protests against conscription"
 fgb.79.d: "At the end of the Great war, and in the enduring cold conflict between much of our neighbours and ourselves, there has been an ongoing sentiment amongst our people subscribing to the idea that Germany has had enough and needs peace, obvious by the state of the Economy and the exhaustion felt by our people. As of late, many have taken to the streets to protest the raised Conscription laws, and some that were to be involved in active service have deserted."
 fgb.79.a: "Unification will never be easy"
 fgb.80.t: "Founding of a New Airforce"
 fgb.80.d: "The Great War, and our pursuent collapse, has resulted in the old imperial airforce to be fragmented among many territories and factions alike, vying for control over what remains, but we will not be dependent on old, poorly-produced planes to serve our skies, no, we will aim for something greater; A New chapter in the history of German Aviation. A new, modern airforce will be rebuilt from the ground up, and will begin as a scouting and sabotaging tool against our adversaries, who threaten our wills of having Germany be one."
 fgb.80.a: "Germany will fly high once again"
 fgb.81.t: "The long days past"
 fgb.81.d: "On January 28th, 1871, the Provisional French Government surrendered to the Prussian Kingdom, marking the end of the Franco-Prussian war, and setting the stage for its new beginning under a unified Germany. Since then, annual celebrations, be it by officials or by simple Germans, have been held in many of Germany's cities. Regardless of where any German is, it is an important moment in our joint history, and the one chapter in Global history that has marked every rival Government in their efforts to unify the State again."
 fgb.81.a: "We will avenge past glories"
 fgb.82.t: "Friedrich Ebert sends his best wishes"
 fgb.82.d: "The German Republic regards our Governor's recent rise in power as one of the first steps in achieving a peaceful reunification of a united Germany. As such, a flurry of support, news agents, and some campaign money arrived as a result of this news. The Hamburg government hopes that our relations will amend and that the dream of German republicanism will survive."
 fgb.82.a: "We hope that we'll eventually unify in peace"
 fgb.83.t: "Stahlhelm forces question new administration"
 fgb.83.d: "The parallel paramilitary group, der Stahlhelm, has announced their displeasure at our governor's recent ascension into power, Hans Vogel. Despite the apparent support awarded by the people, many in the state have refused to acknowledge Hans' inauguration as legitimate, and are striving to take back the seat of power into an authoritarian Government."
 fgb.83.a: "They can bicker all they want"
 fgb.84.t: "The Heidelberg Programme"
 fgb.84.d: "A select group of intellectual industrialists and economic scientists have recently gathered in Heidelberg to scheme plans on how to boot-start the declining German economy, they talk of theories and ideals such as complete autarky and self-reliance, but also having trade dominance and monopoly on certain resources. They devise a premature concept - The Heidelberg Programme, named after the town. It is an economic policy that consits of nationalisation of essential goods and resources, but privatisation of the economy, in a controlled and sustained manner, so that the German economy can grow freely, but if it were ever to collapse, there would be precautions to avoid the worst effects. Many have argued that this is a huge leap towards what will later be a German dominated europe."
 fgb.84.a: "And we have taken the first steps"
 fgb.85.t: "Popularity among female voters soars"
 fgb.85.d: "Our government's recent changes towards the views of the roles of women in voting has resulting in large swathes of women vying for support of a social democratic government. This in turn has created a greater disregard for more authoritarian choices, and has caused a significant increase in the amount of female recruitees in the public sector."

Initially joining the Bavarian pioneers as a volunteer, List quickly impressed with his aptitude for command and was promoted to Lieutenant and attended the Bavarian War Academy. Besides a brief stint in the 1st Bavarian Infantry Regiment, List would immediately shift to staff work, and was an operations planning officer by the start of the Great War. Serving as chief of staff in various divisions, List didn't get his own command until after the war when he made a choice to switch to the mountain troops.\n\nQuickly getting recognised for his skills in training and aptitude for mountain warfare, List was switched to the training department of the Freikorps' Alpine Regiment, where he has served for two years as a valuable asset to the Brigades. As his skills improved, his ranks would rise also, and he came to be known as a Field Marshal by June 1921.§!"
