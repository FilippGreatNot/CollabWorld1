 fgb.1.t: "The Matter of Army Reform"
 fgb.1.d: "Several generals have come to the command to tell us a variety of ideas, and there seems to have formed 2 distinct general ideas as to how the Army Reform may go about. The first camp argues that a quick offensive is necessary to avoid the horrors that were bourne in the depths of the nasty gas-filled trenches, while the other insinuates that careful planning, combined with better logistics, is far more superior, as such a frontline can keep moving and delay or suspend the need for trenche warfare entirely.

 FGB_consequences_of_the_great_war_desc: "The Great War was a disaster for us all.
