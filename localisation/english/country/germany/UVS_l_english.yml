 UVS_disorganised_socialist_militias: "Disorganised Socialist Militias"
 UVS_disorganised_socialist_militias_desc: "In fact, all our forces consist of barely trained, poorly armed and completely disorganised people's militia. Until we create a proper army, any kind of revolution outside our controlled territory is out of question — the only countries left after us would be the Soviet dictatorship and similiar bolshevik regimes. We must thread carefully."
 UVS_disorganised_socialist_militias2: "Brave Socialist Militias"
 UVS_disorganised_socialist_militias2_desc: "We have reorganized the militias and established a somewhat proper military force.

 ### Events ###
 uvs_spartakus.1.t: "The Congress of Spartakusbund"
 uvs_spartakus.1.d: "At last, we can hold the first Congress of the Spartakusbund. The revolution has suceeded but after it a hard power struggle has ensued. At one side is the current leader Rosa Luxemburg who may be considered the center by some. Then there is her long time friend Karl Liebknecht who supports more democratic policies. Of course, there is also the dspd that wants to build a new mix between a parliamentary system and the Rätersystem. On the complete opposite side of the spectrum is the nationalist, schizophrenic in the minds of some, Joachim von Ribentrop. Less radical than him is the heavily Soviet-Aligned Ernst Thälmann who wants to pursue cooperation with the Russians. Now that the congress has ended, we can see who won...  "

 uvs_spartakus.4.t: "Question of the Anarchists"
 uvs_spartakus.4.d: "We have realized that there are many anarchist sympathizers within our ranks and across the parties of the Spartakusbund in general. We have 2 options regarding how to deal with this. First, we could try to remove and purge them from political positions. Or perhaps, we could also embrace them and use them to our own advantage.

 UVS_red_bismarck_desc: "Our glorious Führer is just like Otto von Bismarck, the man who unified Germany. He did so through Iron and Blood, according to himself. Herr Ribbentrop also suceeded in uniting the German People no matter the cost. Many brave soldiers have died fighting against the Imperialist Yoke imposed on us by the savage Russians and the bourgeoisie West. They shall not be forgotten. The Führer will now make a speech honoring Bismarck while clearly comparing himself to him. There is one big difference between the two heroes though: the better one is red.
