 UVS_disorganised_socialist_militias_desc: "In fact, all our forces consist of barely trained, poorly armed and completely disorganised people's militia. Until we create a proper army, any kind of revolution outside our controlled territory is out of question — the only countries left after us would be the Soviet dictatorship and similiar bolshevik regimes. We must thread carefully."
 
 UVS_brave_socialist_militias: "Brave Socialist Militias"
 UVS_brave_socialist_militias_desc: "We have reorganized the militias and established a somewhat proper military force. It is not the best, but our soldiers are known for their bravery in the fight for the revolution and are feared across Europe because of that. Now we can go on with the revolution and reunite the German People as one once again."

 UVS_socialist_patriotism: "Socialist Patriotism"
 UVS_socialist_patriotism_desc: "Unlike Lenin and Marx before him, our glorious chairman Joachim von Ribentrop realized that nationalism is a core part of socialism.

 UVS_fighting_for_freedom_desc: "Some may ask what it is we fight for. Is it for money? No, that is what the capitalist elitists in America fight for, not us. Is it for a monarch? Not at all, that was what the Germany of 1916 fought for, and they are the ones who caused all our strife. What we fight for is Freedom. All people, no matter creed or colour, deserve to be free.

 POLITICS_ROSA_DESC: "Rosa is the main founder of the Communist Party of Germany and the Chairman of the Spartakusbund. She sure has went a long way.

 ### Events ###
 uvs.1.t: "The Congress of Spartakusbund"
 uvs.1.d: "At last, we can hold the first Congress of the Spartakusbund. The revolution has suceeded but after it a hard power struggle has ensued. At one side is the current leader Rosa Luxemburg who may be considered the center by some. Then there is her long time friend Karl Liebknecht who supports more democratic policies. Of course, there is also the dspd that wants to build a new mix between a parliamentary system and the Rätersystem. On the complete opposite side of the spectrum is the nationalist, schizophrenic in the minds of some, Joachim von Ribentrop. Less radical than him is the heavily Soviet-Aligned Ernst Thälmann who wants to pursue cooperation with the Russians. Now that the congress has ended, we can see who won..."
 uvs.1.a: "Spartakusbund will continue the work"

 uvs.1.c: "$UVS_DAA_LONG$"
 uvs.1.e: "$UVS_KPVD_LONG$"
 uvs.1.f: "$UVS_social_democrat_party$"

 uvs.2.t: "Offer from the Spartakusbund"
 uvs.2.d: "Why are you playing as Bavaria rn"
 
 uvs.3.t: "Rosa's Speech"
 uvs.3.d: "«Comrades, the liberation of the German worker awaits! May the capitalist boots across the realm tremble as justice shines accros the land. GENOSSEN, DIE ZEIT IST GEKOMMEN. It is neccesary that each of us gives our best for the revolution. We will establish a true socialist state in Germany, and no capitalist will stop us! May the German Revolution be the Eternal Revolution! VORWÄRTS!»"
 uvs.3.a: "Danke Genossin Luxemburg"
 
 uvs.4.t: "Question of the Anarchists"
 uvs.4.d: "We have realized that there are many anarchist sympathizers within our ranks and across the parties of the Spartakusbund in general. We have 2 options regarding how to deal with this. First, we could try to remove and purge them from political positions. Or perhaps, we could also embrace them and use them to our own advantage. The choice is yours, chairman."
 uvs.4.a: "Cooperation is the Way"
 uvs.4.b: "Purge the Bastards"
 
 uvs.5.t: "Post-Reunification Economic Transition"
 uvs.5.d: "Now that we have secured control over Germany we have to implement our socialist policies far and wide across all of our provinces. This will be painful for the economy, but we will have to do our best to mitigate the consequences of this economic transition. Worst of all, our production efficiency will suffer massively as we switch from a free market into a planned economy."
 uvs.5.a: "Prepare for a Hard Year"
 
 uvs.6.t: "Socialist Germany Buys Our Tungsten"
 uvs.6.d: "The new socialist government in Germany has decided to make a trade deal with us in which we will ship large amounts of Tungsten to their port city of Kiel in return for some juicy economic benefits. This will greatly benefit our economy without nearly any consequences for our resource production since we have too much anyway."
 uvs.6.a: "Great Idea"
 
 uvs.7.t: "The Führer has gone mad!"
 uvs.7.d: "Due to refusing to take his medicine, our glorious Führer Ribentrop has assumed a totally weird new personality and seeks to totally change the country in the most radical way. But he has multiple personalities at this point, and ultimately, only one will come prevalent and decide the future of this country."
 uvs.7.a: "I AM THE MESSIAH"
 uvs.7.b: "Wilhelm is the Kaiser of the People"
 uvs.7.c: "Coup that Madman Now!"
 uvs.7.e: "I am the only man fit to be the Kaiser"
 uvs.8.t: "Planning a Second Four Year Plan"
 uvs.8.d: "Our first Four Year Plan has been a massive success, contributing to a rapid growth of the German Industry excluding the car production incident. Now, it is time for us to repeat these successes, but perhaps in a new field. Our military industry is lacking compared to our civilian industry, so it could be smart to focus on it instead. We can also keep our classic approach too if that's what we preffer though. The chairman will have to make the choice."
 uvs.8.a: "Focus on the Civilian Industry"
 uvs.8.b: "Focus on our Military Production"
 
 uvs.diplomacy.1.t: "Red Germany Rises"
 uvs.diplomacy.1.d: "Despite all the challenges the German Revolution faced, it succeeded and reunited all of Germany under the red banner. We have both political and economic matters to deal with, but after we take care of everything we need to we must spread the Revolution west, either alone or with the help of the Soviets. It is Germany's inevitable destiny to be the harbinger of Communism on the European Continent. The Liberation of the Workers of France who are oppressed by the Cotyist regime awaits, it is only on us to begin the way to domination."
 uvs.diplomacy.1.a: "Once again a superpower"
 
 uvs.diplomacy.2.t: "The Czechoslovak Question"
 uvs.diplomacy.2.d: "Czechoslovakia is an interesting nation as its founding principles of unity are not so far from our own. However, they are plagued by capitalism so we have a duty to cleanse them. Let's choose a way to approach this. We have 3 options. We can do a swift attack, demand the liberation of the workers or demand the sudetenland. The choice lies in the Chairman's hands."
 uvs.diplomacy.2.war: "Strike them by surprise"
 uvs.diplomacy.2.sudetenland: "Demand the Sudetenland"
 uvs.diplomacy.2.flip_commie: "Demand a regime change"
 
 uvs.diplomacy.3.t: "An Ultimatum from the Spartakusbund"
 uvs.diplomacy.3.d: "The German socialists have demanded that we hand over the German-populated Sudetenland over the basis of oppressing its workers, which the government in Berlin believes it has a right to protect. These statements have made our government furious. The advisors recommend us not to cave in to their demands, but it might be neccesary to save the nation from needless war."
 uvs.diplomacy.3.accept: "Hand it over"
 uvs.diplomacy.3.reject: "Better dead than red"
 
 uvs.diplomacy.4.t: "An Ultimatum from the Spartakusbund"
 uvs.diplomacy.4.d: "The German socialists have demanded that we hand over our sovereignty and become a socialist member of their sphere over the basis of oppressing czechoslovak workers, which the government in Berlin believes it has a right to protect. These statements have made our government furious. The advisors recommend us not to cave in to their demands, but it might be neccesary to save the nation from needless war."
 uvs.diplomacy.4.accept: "Submit to their rule"
 
 uvs.diplomacy.5.t: "The Revolution Marches West"
 uvs.diplomacy.5.d: "When Marx made his theories, he never intented for them to arise in Russia. He intented for them to rise in old capitalist industrial nations. His wish was fulfilled when we took control over his home country, but now it is time to take out the 2 countries he lived in and liberate its workers. Only by doing this can we build a European socialist Utopia. Order the army command to send the army to the Rhine."
 uvs.diplomacy.5.a: "Vorwärts, Genossen"
 
 uvs.diplomacy.6.t: "The Duel of the Fates"
 uvs.diplomacy.6.d: "Our war with the French reactionaries will be the most important war of the century. It will decide the fate of the entire world. It is either the Liberation of the workers or reaction and tradition. We must make sure we are prepared to end their racist authoritarian rule. Red Banners will fly high over Paris and their nationalist army won't stop that. This war will be remembered like a Second Weltkrieg. But this time, it is not a war between monarchies but a war between evil and good, a war between the Revolution and the Reaction. Genossen, Vorwärts!"
 uvs.diplomacy.6.a: "Paris stinks"
 
 uvs.diplomacy.7.t: "Message from Berlin"
 uvs.diplomacy.7.d: "Our friends in Germany have requested we give them control over the Empire's old East Prussian lands. They say that a region where people speak German will be better administrated by their government. Most of our government agrees we should hand it over as they are our allies anyways. It won't make socialism weaker. However, the question ultimately lies with you, chairman."
 uvs.diplomacy.7.accept: "Sure, they can have it"
 uvs.diplomacy.7.reject: "This is not aligned with our plans"
 
 uvs.diplomacy.erf_invite.t: "Message from Berlin"
 uvs.diplomacy.erf_invite.accept: "Ally with the Spartakusbund"
 uvs.diplomacy.erf_invite.reject: "Our loyalties lie elsewhere"
 uvs.diplomacy.HUN: "Chairman, we have received the news that the Spartacists from Germany are inviting us to their new alliance named the European Revolutionary Front. This would bring us military and economic benefits in the future and bring us more security, especially since we are surrounded by evil capitalist nationalist states. This alliance is the thing Hungary needs to prevail. We must decide whether to accept the offer. The only thing to note is that accepting this might isolate us from Moscow who have originally been our benefactors in favor of the Spartakusbund. The choice is yours."
 uvs.diplomacy.SWE: "Chairman, we have received the news that the Spartacists from Germany are inviting us to their new alliance named the European Revolutionary Front. They praise our loyalty to the true revolution and note our electoral success. This would bring us military and economic benefits in the future and bring us more security, especially since we are surrounded by evil capitalist states. This alliance is the thing Sweden needs to prevail. We must decide whether to accept the offer. The only thing to note is that accepting this might isolate us from Moscow who have originally been our close partners in favor of the Spartakusbund. The choice is yours."
 WORLDNEWS.21.t: "Democratic Socialists Unite Germany"
 WORLDNEWS.21.d: "When the Spartacist Revolution happened years ago, no one would have thought that it would be victorious. Today it is, and not in the expected way. The DSPD, or the democratic Socialists, won power in the Spartakusbund and united Germany. They established a democracy with socialist economic principles, which many are starting to compare to the Nordic countries. Analysts call this a great and unexpected victory against both leftwing and rightwing extremist ideology. We will inform you on all the further developments sorrounding this."
 WORLDNEWS.21.a: "A Victory for Freedom"
 WORLDNEWS.8.t: "Joachim von Ribentrop Reunites Germany"
 WORLDNEWS.8.d: "The Spartakusbund, lead by the Bismarckist wing under Joachim von Ribentrop have secured control of the German wasteland. This marks a monumental change in world geopolitics as Germany might once become a great power on the world stage. The consequenes of the new reunification are yet to be seen, but Ribentrop has shown nationalistic tendencies often criticized by other communists. Some would go as far as to call him insane. Many rumors sorrounding his mental health have arisen after he made positive comments about Wilhelm II, totally contrary to the Spartacist Principles"
 WORLDNEWS.8.a: "Der Rote Bismarck"
 WORLDNEWS.20.t: "Spartakusbund Reunites Germany"
 WORLDNEWS.20.d: "The Spartacist Movement, led by the radical bolshevik Ernst Thälmann has succesfully achieved the Second Unification of Germany. After the Bavarian guard laid down their arms in Munich, the winner of the war was certain. Ernst Thälmann was not only to be the chairman of the Spartakusbund, but also of the German nation. Now he is facing many challenges, such as the economic transition socialism brought and the fact there are many people who want to see him gone. On top of that, Ernst has shown his intention to become closer with the Soviet Union and perhaps even join the Comintern"
 WORLDNEWS.20.a: "Strange world we live in"
 WORLDNEWS.2.t: "Spartakusbund Reunites Germany"
 WORLDNEWS.2.d: "The Spartacist Movement, led by its founder Rosa Luxemburg has succesfully unified Germany once again. With support from Moscow and a bloody battle for Germany, the marxists have suceeded in achieving their goal in painting Germany a red color. Rosa, while Pro-Soviet, has kept somewhat of a distance from the current Soviet Chairman. It remains to be seen whether she will follow her own foreign policy goals or whether she will stand together with the Soviet Union. One thing is certain though: this is a major threat for the French State. Many think a war between the Socialist Germany and the French Reactionaries is inevitable."
 WORLDNEWS.2.a: "The Red Rose"
 WORLDNEWS.22.t: "Spartakusbund Reunites Germany"
 WORLDNEWS.22.d: "The Spartacist Movement, lead by the famous German revolutionary Karl Liebknecht, has finished the German Revolution and declared a new republic. Liebknecht is known as a fighter for change in the world and will definitely be trying to spread the leftist ideas of the Spartakusbund abroad. The question is whether he will do this together with the Soviet Government, which he has more often than not been critical of, or with his own alliance of socialist states. Europe's destiny is in his hands, and many more will get to write history together with him."

 UVS_red_bismarck_desc: "Our glorious Führer is just like Otto von Bismarck, the man who unified Germany. He did so through Iron and Blood, according to himself. Herr Ribbentrop also suceeded in uniting the German People no matter the cost. Many brave soldiers have died fighting against the Imperialist Yoke imposed on us by the savage Russians and the bourgeoisie West. They shall not be forgotten. The Führer will now make a speech honoring Bismarck while clearly comparing himself to him. There is one big difference between the two heroes though: the better one is red. It is a time to rejoice as the Führer prepares new plans to MAKE GERMANY GREAT AGAIN!"

 UVS_reorganize_the_militias_desc: "It is neccesary that we immedieately reorganize our militias and establish a proper land force.

 UVS_ban_demsocs_desc: "These dirty democratic- socialists- if you can even call them such a word, have been criticizing the Volksführer for longer than they should have been. THESE BASTARDS. We will ban their party and shoot all of them who dare say the Volksführer is a ruthless dictator! How dare they say such a thing! The Volksführer is a very benevolent man. For not agreeing, they will be exiled or worse."
 UVS_cooperate_with_demsocs: "Cooperate with Democratic Socialists"
 UVS_cooperate_with_demsocs_desc: "Liebknecht has always had a soft spot for the DSPD, as many of his past colleagues and friends from the SPD are now a part of it. With our ideological similarities, it should not be difficult to convince them to formalise an alliance of some sorts, as it would benefit both our parties, as well as the stability of the nation."
 UVS_criticize_nationalists: "Criticize Nationalists"
 UVS_criticize_nationalists_desc: "Nationalism and socialism do NOT go hand-in-hand. Nationalism is a concept spawned from the ruling classes’ efforts to divide the lower classes and keep themselves in power. A classless society is free from nationalist degeneracy, as a classless society can only be created when the entire world is liberated and under a marxist system. The nationalists in our country do not understand this. We must educate them."

Soon, all of Germany will be under socialism and then the revolution will flourish across all of Europe forevermore! Through the wisdom of our great chairman Rosa we have been able to accomplish many great things. The people are happy, the economy is booming and everything is well. Soon, we might even be able to hold a Second Congress of the Spartakusbund deciding what to do in the near future and who will lead us after Rosa. Will Rosa even remain as the chairman? That remains to be seen. We certainly hope so."

 UVS_decentralized_research_desc: "Liebknecht believes we can improve the quality of our government’s scientific research through a series of decentralisation acts. The method in which topics are researched must be layered, with a couple people working on different things at the same time, rather than everyone working on one thing. This will increase productivity and the speed at which things are researched."

 UVS_unity_in_diversity_desc: "It's okay to have a different opinion! Disagreements are a natural part of society, not something that should be shunned.

We are united in the fact that we can disagree, united in the fact we all have diverse opinions that we can express."

 UVS_free_revolution_desc: "We have done it! Through all the reforms, Liebknecht and the KPVD has shaped the German nation into a ‘state’ Marx would surely be proud of. It will not be long at all before all of Europe, and eventually the world, follows Liebknechtism and Marxist ideals. As long as Liebknicht lives, the freedom of the German people will be protected, and no one will be able to take it from them again. Hooray to Liebknecht!"
 UVS_ribentrop_doctrine: "The Ribentrop Doctrine"
 UVS_ribentrop_doctrine_desc: "The economic doctrine of our Volksführer is to heavily militarize the state in order to get it ready to fight the reactionary capitalists west of us. If we don't properly get ready militarily, we will inevitably be crushed by these capitalist forces. Of course, some people won't like that the Volksführer isnt focusing on the people first, but ultimately this will save the people from these capitalists in the long run."

 UVS_tough_methods: "Modernize our Industry"
 UVS_tough_methods_desc: "The truth is that the establishment of a true socialist economy requires a modern industrial state. The civil war which has taken over Germany has set our industry back a decade. We need to modernize our machines and tools in order to boost our production and make a true socialist state.

Although we have freed ourselves from their reign, many still remain in the country, hiding in the shadows and plotting malicious schemes against the government. Thälmann has ordered a list be made of all prominent capitalist figures in the country, that they be rounded up, and “dealt with.” Some may call us inhumane for this, but if we don't do it, their schemes may be realised and Germany’s newfound freedom would be ripped away in an instant."

We've secured the revolution militarily, and now we must do it internally. Inviting Menzhinsky, an experienced member of the RSFSR's secret police, to help us establish our own internal security organization, will help secure us against these threats."

 UVS_german_chekists_desc: "Menzhinsky’s advisory in the country is proving to be a great help to our secret services, the Volkspolizei. Still though, we could do with more help in making the secret services even more effective; that is where the Soviet Cheka comes in, Russia’s own secret police, which is very well established and advanced in its field.

Let's see what can be done."

 UVS_buy_swedish_guns_desc: "Sweden is a light of stability in northern Europe. They have built a powerful industry and their government likely aligns with our own goals and values. They might not be THE revolution, but they are certainly close to our cause so we should seek to cooperate by purchasing some of their high quality guns. Sweden is a nation of innovation and social democracy and we want more of that in Germany than less, so let's buy their guns rather than import Soviet trash."

 UVS_deal_with_social_fascists_desc: "The Austerity policies of the Kaiserreich caused great damage to the Wellbeing of the German people, especially the poor population.

Well, we understand that money is made through productivity, and productivity is NOT made through endangering your workers and making them resent you.

 UVS_a_gun_for_every_worker_desc: "If we want to be able to defend the revolution with the little manpower we have, we will need to make sure every worker is armed to the teeth and ready to defend german socialism.

 UVS_the_progress_initiative_desc: "The rate of development of a society depends largely on its scientific advancements. Science is the reason European nations attained guns and were able to conquer the world, and it is also the reason they were able to improve their healthcare and public services to have people live longer.

 UVS_keep_council_rule_desc: "We should learn from history. Centralising power in a single individual will always lead to disaster and a more authoritarian state in general.

 UVS_give_rule_to_ebert_desc: "Many from within the government are calling for Friedrich Ebert Jr. to be made the sole leader of the country. A very young politician who has been gaining much popularity as of late, Ebert has an unfortunate family situation, his father being the president of the enemy republic to our west. Although most are sympathetic to Ebert and his terribly saddening relationship with his father, some believe he would not be truly disloyal to the socialist cause because of relation to the enemy.  Ebert Jr. is, though, a good man, and the joint rule of the party must come to an end, so we shall give him rule over the nation."

 UVS_question_of_anarchists_desc: "We have noticed that many anarchists have pragmatically allied with our cause in order to weaken the bureaucracy established by Rosa and Liebknecht.

 UVS_left_accelerationism_desc: "Truth be told, the Weltkrieg severely weakened our industrial capabilites and we need to build new means of production in order to compete with the rest of Germany, which is more industrialised than us anyway.

It remains to be seen what we should do with the ethnic Poles living in the region... They are, in the end, equals to us. We must strive to be socialists in our approach to them."

This is surprising and most of the country is boiling with rage as the DSPD is still viewed as a capitalist appeaser party. How the DSPD will get rid of this reputation is yet to be seen.

It is time to erase the capitalist stain from our nation entirely!"
 UVS_support_the_poor: "Support the Poor"
 UVS_support_the_poor_desc: "A nation relies on its people and its patriotism. Germany’s citizens have gone through many, many hardships in the past years, and the strength of their nationalist spirit has deteriorated significantly as a result. To ensure the stability and strength of our nation, we must make the people fonder of their government, and assist them in recovering from the poverty many have fallen into through tax cuts and economic relief programs. This will take time, but will benefit the country’s economy and our regime’s support greatly."
 UVS_economic_austerity: "Economic Austerity"
 UVS_economic_austerity_desc: "The German economy is in a terrible place right now, and we have little time to fix it. If we wish for a speedy industrial recovery, we must unfortunately introduce austerity measures for our people. Tax increases and spending cuts will be put in place. Although this may damage our support, we must have a strong economy and industry built quickly if we wish to liberate all of Europe in a timely manner."
 UVS_first_four_year_plan: "Draft Our First 4-Year Plan"
 UVS_first_four_year_plan_desc: "Popular Marxist theory calls for a centralised economy handled primarily by the government to avoid capitalist monopolies. We shall institute a system of 4-Year Plans to have as much control over our economy as possible and guide it towards prosperity."
 UVS_east_railway_expansion: "Eastern Railway Expansion Project"
 UVS_east_railway_expansion_desc: "Our army currently has been having some trouble getting around the country, as our railroads are quite damaged from the civil war, and some were even completely destroyed. We shall focus on building new railroads across the country."
 UVS_silesian_aluminium: "Grow Silesian Aluminium Production"
 UVS_silesian_aluminium_desc: "Aluminium is an incredibly important resource, needed for planes, which have been becoming increasingly essential components of modern warfare. We shall focus on increasing the amount we produce in Silesia, an aluminium-wealthy area. This will attract more industry to the area."
 UVS_pomeranian_steel: "Expand the Pomeranian Steel Industry"
 UVS_pomeranian_steel_desc: "Steel is an essential material, needed in all sorts of military equipment, as well as building construction. We shall focus on increasing the amount we produce in Pomerania by building dozens of steel mills in the area. This will attract more industry to the area."

 UVS_swedish_tungsten_trade_deal_desc: "The current democracy in Sweden isn't that far off ideologically from us, judging by their social security programs and care for the people. They are a perfect partner. We are in need of Tungsten, so we should make a deal with Sweden to get more from their mines transported right into the ports in Kiel, all free of tarrifs or anything like that. It will be a trade deal which will benefit both of our nations for the good of our peoples."
 UVS_begin_agricultural_collectivization: "Begin Agricultural Collectivization"
 UVS_begin_agricultural_collectivization_desc: "The Bureau of Economic Affairs has finally finally a plan in the works for years: agricultural collectivization. Farms will be owned by the government who will distribute the farms’ yields to consumers, then split profits between the farmers. This will destabilise the nation and economy as the farmers fight our reforms, but it will eventually pay off well, as we will have more control over the economy and the direction it goes in."
 UVS_we_will_increase_our_yield: "We Will Increase Our Yield!"
 UVS_we_will_increase_our_yield_desc: "Our farms currently do not provide as much food as possible, and for that reason many peasants are going hungry. We must implement as many measures as possible to increase our yield, like buying experimental fertilisers and using new technologies like tractors."
 UVS_establish_farmer_soviets: "Establish Farmer Soviets"
 UVS_establish_farmer_soviets_desc: "The popularity of our reforms among the farmers is very low, as many are resentful that we have taken their rights to individually own farms away. Their frustrations are understandable, but we cannot simply undo all our progress so far. What we can do, though, is give them the ability to voice their frustrations and have at least some power. Through establishing farmer soviets (workers’ councils)  in individual farms, decisions can be made democratically through a system of voting by the farmers. This will hopefully stabilise the tense situation with the farmers and increase their productivity."
 UVS_land_for_the_farmers_food_for_the_people: "Land for the Farmers, Food for the People"
 UVS_land_for_the_farmers_food_for_the_people_desc: "The farmers now control their farms through their councils, and as such have been relatively appeased. This, paired with the incredible success of our efforts to increase the farms’ yields, has created a surge in production in food. German people across the country are now well-fed and enjoying 3 hearty meals every day. Our efforts have helped stabilise the economy, and is a major step on the road towards eliminating poverty from our fatherland."

 UVS_nationalize_the_rhenish_industrial_centers_desc: "The Rhineland has always been the Heartland of the German Industry. This land, filled with factories and brave workers, has made Germany the most powerful modern industrial state. Now that Marxism rules over the land, we have the opportunity to truly liberate the workers of the Rhineland by nationalizing the factory centers present there at the moment. This will strenghten our production capabilities and bring us closer to True Economic Socialism."
 UVS_modernize_road_system_desc: "Our system of connecting the countryside to the cities and vice versa has become somewhat outdated compared to other European States despite our industrial power. The civil war took its toll, and it is our duty to rebuild and connect Germany once more, this time with the power of socialism!"

 UVS_a_true_volkswagen: "A True Volkswagen"
 UVS_a_true_volkswagen_desc: "A People's Car, a Volkswagen, will be our newest invention in making Germany a prosperous socialist state. We will provide every German family with a good car, free of charge. We will do so by expanding our car industry with the funds we received from nationalizing evil capitalist businesses. What this will also do is provide us a good industry for producing motorized equipment in the case of a war in the nearby future. Overall, it is a worthwhile investment. Many liberal agitators have criticized us and said our production system won't be able to make this many cars and that people will have to wait for years, but what do they know?"

 UVS_plan_a_second_four_year_plan_desc: "Our first Four Year Plan has been a massive success, contributing to a rapid growth of the German Industry excluding the car production incident. Now, it is time for us to repeat these successes, but perhaps in a new field. Our military industry is lacking compared to our civilian industry, so it could be smart to focus on it instead. We can also keep our classic approach too if that's what we preffer though. The chairman will have to make the choice."

 UVS_a_military_orientated_four_year_plan_desc: "Our production capabilities, militarily, are lacking a lot. If we continue like this, the reactionaries of France will destroy us and end the Revolution here and now. Expanding the Military Industry of the Volksrepublik is a must."
 UVS_a_civilian_orientated_four_year_plan: "A Civilian-Orientated Four Year Plan"
 UVS_a_civilian_orientated_four_year_plan_desc: "The military does not serve the people. We must continue prioritizing the German Worker, and not the army. We are ultimately serving them. Our goals must be focused on peace and rebuilding the nation, not the opposite. On top of that, we can also dominate economically. No need for these massive radical changes."

With our political ideal finally realized within Germany, obviously its one and only successor, and its resources and manpower having come under our mandate, we need to address the question of international relations, and where our Revolutionary Project stands on the world stage. Given the lack of international recognition due to our Marxist principles, this is really a question on how best to support the spread of Communist ideology:  We can either create our own bloc, for nurturing our own conceptions of the communist ideal within Europe; Or, align ourselves with the pre-eminent Communist interest in Europe - and the world - Lenin's Comintern faction."

It was the French, the German people’s eternal enemy, who wanted nothing more than to cripple our will and strength. But they made a mistake in doing so, as from the chaos of the German Anarchy came our glorious revolution, a revolution dedicated to its people far more than the previous monarchy. Our new, powerful spirit will cripple the reactionary and authoritarian elitists in France, and finally, the French and German people will cease to be enemies, united in ideology."

The polity which most obviously seeks confrontation is The French State, home to a Reactionary, Counter-Revolutionary, Conservative movement that wishes to see us crushed underfoot - Both ideologically, and nationally, for the sake of their own national pride and Palingenesis.
