 UVS_disorganised_socialist_militias: "Disorganised Socialist Militias"
 UVS_disorganised_socialist_militias_desc: "In fact, all our forces consist of barely trained, poorly armed and completely disorganised people's militia. Until we create a proper army, any kind of revolution outside our controlled territory is out of question — the only countries left after us would be the Soviet dictatorship and similiar bolshevik regimes. We must thread carefully."

 ### Events ###
 uvs.1.t: "The Congress of Spartakusbund"
 uvs.1.d: "At last, we can hold the first Congress of the Spartakusbund. The revolution has suceeded but after it a hard power struggle has ensued. At one side is the current leader Rosa Luxemburg who may be considered the center by some. Then there is her long time friend Karl Liebknecht who supports more democratic policies. Of course, there is also the dspd that wants to build a new mix between a parliamentary system and the Rätersystem. On the complete opposite side of the spectrum is the nationalist, schizophrenic in the minds of some, Joachim von Ribentrop. Less radical than him is the heavily Soviet-Aligned Ernst Thälmann who wants to pursue cooperation with the Russians. Now that the congress has ended, we can see who won..."

 uvs.2.d: "Why are you playing as Bavaria rn"
 
 uvs.3.t: "Rosa's Speech"
 uvs.3.d: "«Comrades, the liberation of the German worker awaits! May the capitalist boots across the realm tremble as justice shines accros the land. GENOSSEN, DIE ZEIT IST GEKOMMEN. It is neccesary that each of us gives our best for the revolution. We will establish a true socialist state in Germany, and no capitalist will stop us! May the German Revolution be the Eternal Revolution! VORWÄRTS!»"
 uvs.3.a: "Danke Genossin Luxemburg"
 
 uvs.4.t: "Question of the Anarchists"
 uvs.4.d: "We have realized that there are many anarchist sympathizers within our ranks and across the parties of the Spartakusbund in general. We have 2 options regarding how to deal with this. First, we could try to remove and purge them from political positions. Or perhaps, we could also embrace them and use them to our own advantage. The choice is yours, chairman."
 uvs.4.a: "Cooperation is the Way"
 uvs.4.b: "Purge the Bastards"
 
 uvs.5.t: "Post-Reunification Economic Transition"
 uvs.5.d: "Now that we have secured control over Germany we have to implement our socialist policies far and wide across all of our provinces. This will be painful for the economy, but we will have to do our best to mitigate the consequences of this economic transition. Worst of all, our production efficiency will suffer massively as we switch from a free market into a planned economy."
 uvs.5.a: "Prepare for a Hard Year"
 
 uvs.6.t: "Socialist Germany Buys Our Tungsten"
 uvs.6.d: "The new socialist government in Germany has decided to make a trade deal with us in which we will ship large amounts of Tungsten to their port city of Kiel in return for some juicy economic benefits. This will greatly benefit our economy without nearly any consequences for our resource production since we have too much anyway."
 uvs.6.a: "Great Idea"
 
 uvs.diplomacy.1.t: "Red Germany Rises"
 uvs.diplomacy.1.d: "Despite all the challenges the German Revolution faced, it succeeded and reunited all of Germany under the red banner. We have both political and economic matters to deal with, but after we take care of everything we need to we must spread the Revolution west, either alone or with the help of the Soviets. It is Germany's inevitable destiny to be the harbinger of Communism on the European Continent. The Liberation of the Workers of France who are oppressed by the Cotyist regime awaits, it is only on us to begin the way to domination."
 uvs.diplomacy.1.a: "Once again a superpower"
 
 uvs.diplomacy.2.t: "The Czechoslovak question"
 uvs.diplomacy.2.d: "Czechoslovakia is an interesting nation as its founding principles of unity are not so far from our own. However, they are plagued by capitalism so we have a duty to cleanse them. Let's choose a way to approach this. We have 3 options. We can do a swift attack, demand the liberation of the workers or demand the sudetenland. The choice lies in the Chairman's hands."

 uvs.diplomacy.2.sudetenland: "Demand the Sudetenland"
 uvs.diplomacy.2.flip_commie: "Demand a regime change"
 
 uvs.diplomacy.3.t: "An Ultimatum from the Spartakusbund"
 uvs.diplomacy.3.d: "The German socialists have demanded that we hand over the German-populated Sudetenland over the basis of oppressing its workers, which the government in Berlin believes it has a right to protect. These statements have made our government furious. The advisors recommend us not to cave in to their demands, but it might be neccesary to save the nation from needless war."
 uvs.diplomacy.3.accept: "Hand it over"
 uvs.diplomacy.3.reject: "Better dead than red"
 
 uvs.diplomacy.4.t: "An Ultimatum from the Spartakusbund"
 uvs.diplomacy.4.d: "The German socialists have demanded that we hand over our sovereignty and become a socialist member of their sphere over the basis of oppressing czechoslovak workers, which the government in Berlin believes it has a right to protect. These statements have made our government furious. The advisors recommend us not to cave in to their demands, but it might be neccesary to save the nation from needless war."
 uvs.diplomacy.4.accept: "Submit to their rule"
 
 uvs.diplomacy.5.t: "The Revolution Marches West"
 uvs.diplomacy.5.d: "When Marx made his theories, he never intented for them to arise in Russia. He intented for them to rise in old capitalist industrial nations. His wish was fulfilled when we took control over his home country, but now it is time to take out the 2 countries he lived in and liberate its workers. Only by doing this can we build a European socialist Utopia. Order the army command to send the army to the Rhine."
 uvs.diplomacy.5.a: "Vorwärts, Genossen"
 
 uvs.diplomacy.6.t: "The Duel of the Fates"
 uvs.diplomacy.6.d: "Our war with the French reactionaries will be the most important war of the century. It will decide the fate of the entire world. It is either the Liberation of the workers or reaction and tradition. We must make sure we are prepared to end their racist authoritarian rule. Red Banners will fly high over Paris and their nationalist army won't stop that. This war will be remembered like a Second Weltkrieg. But this time, it is not a war between monarchies but a war between evil and good, a war between the Revolution and the Reaction. Genossen, Vorwärts!"
 uvs.diplomacy.6.a: "Paris stinks"
 
 uvs.diplomacy.7.t: "Message from Berlin"
 uvs.diplomacy.7.d: "Our friends in Germany have requested we give them control over the Empire's old East Prussian lands. They say that a region where people speak German will be better administrated by their government. Most of our government agrees we should hand it over as they are our allies anyways. It won't make socialism weaker. However, the question ultimately lies with you, chairman."
 uvs.diplomacy.7.accept: "Sure, they can have it"
 uvs.diplomacy.7.reject: "This is not aligned with our plans"
 
 uvs.diplomacy.erf_invite.t: "Message from Berlin"
 uvs.diplomacy.erf_invite.accept: "Ally with the Spartakusbund"
 uvs.diplomacy.erf_invite.reject: "Our loyalties lie elsewhere"
 uvs.diplomacy.HUN: "Chairman, we have received the news that the Spartacists from Germany are inviting us to their new alliance named the European Revolutionary Front. This would bring us military and economic benefits in the future and bring us more security, especially since we are surrounded by evil capitalist nationalist states. This alliance is the thing Hungary needs to prevail. We must decide whether to accept the offer. The only thing to note is that accepting this might isolate us from Moscow who have originally been our benefactors in favor of the Spartakusbund. The choice is yours."
 uvs.diplomacy.SWE: "Chairman, we have received the news that the Spartacists from Germany are inviting us to their new alliance named the European Revolutionary Front. They praise our loyalty to the true revolution and note our electoral success. This would bring us military and economic benefits in the future and bring us more security, especially since we are surrounded by evil capitalist states. This alliance is the thing Sweden needs to prevail. We must decide whether to accept the offer. The only thing to note is that accepting this might isolate us from Moscow who have originally been our close partners in favor of the Spartakusbund. The choice is yours."

He destroyed churches, ruined his country's culture and followed the radical philosophies of his Bolshevist compatriots way too closely. We must take into account the fact that he is a traitor and we must not cooperate with the Soviet Union."

 UVS_red_bismarck_desc: "Our glorious Führer is just like Otto von Bismarck, the man who unified Germany. He did so through Iron and Blood, according to himself. Herr Ribbentrop also suceeded in uniting the German People no matter the cost. Many brave soldiers have died fighting against the Imperialist Yoke imposed on us by the savage Russians and the bourgeoisie West. They shall not be forgotten. The Führer will now make a speech honoring Bismarck while clearly comparing himself to him. There is one big difference between the two heroes though: the better one is red. It is a time to rejoice as the Führer prepares new plans to MAKE GERMANY GREAT AGAIN!"

Let's see what can be done."

 UVS_buy_swedish_guns_desc: "Sweden is a light of stability in northern Europe. They have built a powerful industry and their government likely aligns with our own goals and values. They might not be THE revolution, but they are certainly close to our cause so we should seek to cooperate by purchasing some of their high quality guns. Sweden is a nation of innovation and social democracy and we want more of that in Germany than less, so let's buy their guns rather than import Soviet trash."

 UVS_crush_the_invaders: "Crush the Invaders"
 UVS_crush_the_invaders_desc: "The time has come to destroy the so called Polish Liberation Army. They are reactionaries and don't fight for the true liberation of the Polish people. Once we reunify German lands, we will make sure to be the first ones to help liberate the Polish people from the hands of the Red Napoleon's tyrannical regime."
 UVS_destroy_monuments: "Destroy Polish Monuments"
 UVS_destroy_monuments_desc: "These Polish Reactionaries saw Silesia as their land. This is absolutely unacceptable. Silesia is obviously German, and now it is socialist as well. All Polish Monuments in Silesia must be destroyed as this is, clearly, pure German land and the Poles should have never tried taking it in the first place. It remains to be seen what we should do with the ethnic Poles living in the region... They are, in the end, equals to us. We must strive to be socialists in our approach to them."
 UVS_rally_northern_leftists: "Rally Northern Leftists"
 UVS_rally_northern_leftists_desc: "There are many leftists who spy for us in the Hamburger Republic. We should once again rally them behind our cause and get them ready to support our war of liberation. Afterwards, we can already sort of easily establish socialist institutions in the region."
 UVS_destroy_capitalist_swine: "Finish the Revolution"
 UVS_destroy_capitalist_swine_desc: "The time has come to end the corrupt Republic and make sure the German Workers are liberated and living in prosperity. This war will be costly, but we will make sure we are the ones who will ultimately come out on top and secure Victory."
 UVS_turn_spd_voters: "Turn SPD Voters"
 UVS_turn_spd_voters_desc: "Many voters of the former SPD can be turned to true Socialism and made loyal backers of our Bund. We must teach them why their so called social democracy is not the solution and why communism is. This will secure our rule in the region."
 UVS_north_is_red: "The North is Red!"
 UVS_north_is_red_desc: "We have now fully liberated the north from the reactionary army in Silesia and the Hamburger Republic. This allows us to finally be able to breathe a sigh of relief as uniting the south should be easier than the war against the capitalists we fought previously. Vorwärts, Genossen!"
 UVS_destroy_anarchists: "Snap Back to Reality!"
 UVS_destroy_monarchists: "Destroy the Monarchists!"
 UVS_destroy_monarchists_desc: "The imperialists in Dusseldorf are one of the biggest threats to the German Worker. They must be eliminated and all of their generals and war criminals purged. They were the ones who plunged our country into the state it is right now in the first place. So why should we let these reactionary capitalists rule over Germany again? We shouldn't. They must be dealt with immedieately."
 UVS_destroy_nationalists: "End the Reactionaries!"
 UVS_destroy_nationalists_desc: "The Freikorps is the dirtiest most criminal organization in all of Germany. Its a band of war criminals who teamed up to fulfill their evil desires, all of which go against the interests of the people and the workerforce of Germany. We should invade their lands and hang all of their evil leaders who plunged this country into chaos. By far, they are the most evil gang present in this nation."
 UVS_open_trade: "Open Trade"
 UVS_open_trade_desc: "With the defeat of the mutineers of Bremen we can finally reopen our trade routes to the world and import and export neccesary products. This will greatly boost our economic strength and grant us an advantage over the rest of the warlords who seek to oppres the German worker. With these new trade routes, we will bring prosperity to the People."

 UVS_victory_of_dspd: "Victory for the DemSocs"
 UVS_victory_of_dspd_desc: "A big surprise has happened today as the democratic socialist party called the DSPD secured victory in the elections. This is surprising and most of the country is boiling with rage as the DSPD is still viewed as a capitalist appeaser party. How the DSPD will get rid of this reputation is yet to be seen. On top of that, many question how the system of the Spartakusbund will change now considering they have secured victory."

 UVS_appease_monsocs: "Appease Monarchist Socialists"
 UVS_appease_monsocs_desc: "Surprisingly we have found a group we might as well be able to tolerate: the monarchist socialists. We can use them to boost the integration speed in Dusseldorf and support our efforts to make Germany a united nation."

 UVS_execute_nazis: "Execute Them!"
 UVS_execute_nazis_desc: "These lands are filled with reactionary degenerate nationalist scum. They all must either go to prison or be eliminated from the face of this earth. Hang them all! NO MERCY FOR NAZIS. Death to the old order, long live the new one! Equality before all."

 UVS_go_south: "Down South in the Land of Traitors"
 UVS_go_south_desc: "The Southerners in Bavaria have betrayed socialism and made their own nation-state. They will now be utterly destroyed together with their reactionary government. It is an unfortunate state of affairs, but these traitors to our cause must be completely destroyed and Germany reunified. We have no choice, it is as if we were at gunpoint."

 UVS_south_negotiate: "Offer them Reunification"
 UVS_south_negotiate_desc: "The Bavarians are our brothers. They also had their own revolution. We will humbly offer them to unite with us and become a new part of a bigger socialist Germany in the future. Most likely, they will accept. But if they refuse... then the consequences will be severe. Let's see what happens. "

 UVS_endlich_einigkeit: "Endlich Einigkeit"
 UVS_endlich_einigkeit_desc: "At last, Germany has been reunified and the people's revolution has been achieved throughout the realm. Comrades, I am proud of you. Now it is time to take our nation to new heights and expand the revolution west, east and south! We must build a new beautiful society based upon socialist values. But for now, let's celebrate and enjoy the fireworks."
