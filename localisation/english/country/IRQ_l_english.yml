 irq.1.t: "The Cradle of Civilization"
 irq.1.d: "The Lands of Iraq, historically known as Mesopotamia, have been home to many ancient civilizations like the Assyrians or the Babylonians. These were the first civilizations that walked the face of this earth. We bear their legacy as the cradle of all progress and all the best things humanity has to offer. The Modern Iraq is a bit weak. Having gained our independence when the British Empire started to crumble after the failed attack on Northwestern Russia, we are now able to decide our own destiny, without British or Ottoman hands deciding how to opress us next. We must make Iraq strong again, either through the force of arms or through economic prowess."
 irq.1.a: "Iraq will Endure"
 irq.2.t: "The Hashemite Legacy"
 irq.2.d: "The Hashemite heritage, tracing back its roots to the Prophet Peace and Blessings be upon him, played a significant role in liberating the middle east from the corrupt ottoman government in the 1910s. Now our peninsula finaly stands independent, and 3 hashemite kings rule over 3 domains. In Jordan, the Nephew of King Faisal rules and awaits integration. In Hejaz, Faisal's father tries to endure against the Saudi menace. It is, however, most likely that Faisal will be the king if Arabia truly was to unite into a single state."
 irq.2.a: "For King Faisal!"
 irq.3.t: "The Iraqi Parliament's First Session"
 irq.3.d: "Today is the first session of the newly established Iraqi Parliament. Many are wondering how it will go and how the institution will use its new found power. Will they endorse and thank Faisal? Well, some voices are silently informing that they might be planning to oust him..."
 irq.3.a: "Long Live Faisal the Unifier!"
 irq.3.b: "No more Kings!"
 irq.4.t: "Military Reforms"
 irq.4.d: "It has become evidently clear to the government that we need to reform our military in order to be on the level of the countries around us. We need to modernize it and make it able to defend us from foreign invasions or make it more focused on offensive operations. Those are the two choices. However, the general Bakr Sidqi is considering doing a military coup to depose Faisal I, as he views him as too incompetent to properly defend Iraq from foreign countries"
 irq.4.a: "Focus on the Offensive"
 irq.4.b: "We will defend Iraq"
 irq.4.c: "Faisal's End has come"
