 IRQ_power_struggle_decisions: "The Reformist-Traditionalist Conflict"
 IRQ_BOOKMARK_DESC: "With the Collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the hands of the British Empire and the sudden withdrawal of the British Armed Forces from the peninsula, Iraq is finally fully independent under the leadership of the Hashemite King Faisal I. Maybe now, Iraq can stand as a proud free nation and make a change in the world by either expanding for its national interests, becoming economically powerful or perhaps even uniting the Arab peoples. The future of Iraq is yet to be decided, and many seek to take the reins and shape the future as they wish."

 IRQ_first_the_cradle_of_civilization_desc: "Iraq can be considered one of the oldest civilized regions in the world. Many nations and civilizations have arisen and fallen in Mesopotamia, but eventually for hundreds of years we ended up being oppressed by both the Safavid and Ottoman Empires. Now, through the events of the Great War and the involvment of the Ottoman Empire on the side of the Central Powers, we have gained independence through the help of the British with the Hashemite dynasty as our leading force. Now that the British have pulled out of the region, we can finally bring glory to Iraq and Arabia in general. Under the genius leadership of Faisal the Unifier, we will be able to achieve many great things for for this country. May Allah be on our side. For Iraq!

The land of pink trees and financial opportunity. We will help establish a Japanese embassy and seek to make a trade deal with the country.

 ## Events ##
 
 irq.1.t: "The Cradle of Civilization"
 irq.1.d: "The Lands of Iraq, historically known as Mesopotamia, have been home to many ancient civilizations like the Assyrians or the Babylonians. These were the first civilizations that walked the face of this earth. We bear their legacy as the cradle of all progress and all the best things humanity has to offer. The Modern Iraq is a bit weak. Having gained our independence when the British Empire started to crumble after the failed attack on Northwestern Russia, we are now able to decide our own destiny, without British or Ottoman hands deciding how to opress us next. We must make Iraq strong again, either through the force of arms or through economic prowess."
 irq.1.a: "Iraq will Endure"
 irq.2.t: "The Hashemite Legacy"
 irq.2.d: "The Hashemite heritage, tracing back its roots to the Prophet Peace and Blessings be upon him, played a significant role in liberating the middle east from the corrupt ottoman government in the 1910s. Now our peninsula finaly stands independent, and 3 hashemite kings rule over 3 domains. In Jordan, the Nephew of King Faisal rules and awaits integration. In Hejaz, Faisal's father tries to endure against the Saudi menace. It is, however, most likely that Faisal will be the king if Arabia truly was to unite into a single state."
 irq.2.a: "For King Faisal!"
 irq.3.t: "The Iraqi Parliament's First Session"
 irq.3.d: "Today is the first session of the newly established Iraqi Parliament. Many are wondering how it will go and how the institution will use its new found power. Will they endorse and thank Faisal? Well, some voices are silently informing that they might be planning to oust him..."
 irq.3.a: "Long Live Faisal the Unifier!"
 irq.3.b: "No more Kings!"
 irq.4.t: "Military Reforms"
 irq.4.d: "It has become evidently clear to the government that we need to reform our military in order to be on the level of the countries around us. We need to modernize it and make it able to defend us from foreign invasions or make it more focused on offensive operations. Those are the two choices. However, the general Bakr Sidqi is considering doing a military coup to depose Faisal I, as he views him as too incompetent to properly defend Iraq from foreign countries"
 irq.4.a: "Focus on the Offensive"
 irq.4.b: "We will defend Iraq"
 irq.4.c: "Faisal's End has come"
 irq.5.t: "Iraq Seeks to Join our Faction"
 irq.5.d: "The country of Iraq has made a request to our government to have closer relationship and they have also requested that they be admited into our military pact in order to contribute to the mutual defense between our two countries, both of which have common enemies. Should we accept?"
 irq.5.a: "No, Iraq has no place here."
 irq.5.b: "Welcome Iraqi Friends!"
 irq.6.t: "Iraqi Foreign Policy"
 irq.6.d: "We have to decide which approach we will take to foreign policy. Should we seek to protect our regional interests by gaining influence over our neighbors and building our defenses, or should we seek a more important role in unifying the Arab World under one banner. King Faisal I will have to make a choice, and it will be a permanent one with consequences"
 irq.6.a: "We are the Prussia of Arabia"
 irq.6.b: "We will defend our national interests"
