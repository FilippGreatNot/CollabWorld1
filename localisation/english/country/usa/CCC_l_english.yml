 # Focuses #
 
 USA_mc_to_save_a_nation: "To Save a Nation"
 USA_mc_to_save_a_nation_desc: "America has arisen once again. The old man Rockefeller has kicked the bucket, and with him dead his ugly regime has collapsed. The Battle Hymn of the Republic shall be heard all across America soon. We have taken control of Arizona and New Mexico. We must now reorganize our forces and get ready to win this civil war. Its an unfortunate turn of events that the country has collapsed like this, but we should look to the future and be optimistic. Our great nation will be united again under a true demoratic government and our American institutions will be restored. For Freedom!"
 USA_mc_convice_the_military: "Convince the Military"
 USA_mc_convice_the_military_desc: "The General Staff of the MacArthur Resistance is loyal to our leadership, but we will still have to convince them in our ability to restore order in America and establish a new future filled with liberty and freedom. We shall hold a meeting where MacArthur can share his ideas and convince them of his leadership prowess. Only by uniting the nation, the generals included, can we achieve national stability."
 USA_mc_secure_the_towns: "Secure the Towns"
 USA_mc_secure_the_towns_desc: "Our towns, with the takeover of the resistance militias, have seen an increase in criminality and violence. We must impose martial law in specific areas in order to be able to restore order and get the nation back on track. If we continue like this, all the businesses will close and we will have a major economic and societal crisis at our hands. We are also getting reports that Mexican immigrants are eating dogs and cats in our cities. We must immedieately crack down on their dogeating practices."
 USA_mc_promise_democracy: "Promise Them Democracy!"
 USA_mc_promise_democracy_desc: "The Rockefeller regime corrupted our democratic institutions and made our people into the slaves of big corporations. We must sure this never happens again. We shall promise the people what they want: the full return of democracy and the trials of corrupt politicians influenced by the corporations. Justice will be restored to this nation, even if the radicals and the corporations don't agree. The people support us, and not them."
 USA_mc_rally_the_people: "Rally the American People"
 USA_mc_rally_the_people_desc: "All the other factions that are present in this country hate the people. They only seek to benefit themselves. The corporations care about money, the socialists care about pushing the marxist agenda, the KKK are just degenerates and everyone else is either irrelevant or insane. We are the only force for good in this country, and we must rally the people behind our noble cause."
 USA_mc_declare_macarthur_president: "Declare MacArthur President"
 USA_mc_declare_macarthur_president_desc: "Hard times require radical measures. In order to strenghten our legitimacy, we will need to swear in Douglas MacArthur as the new president of the United States. Once America is free again, we will be able to hold real elections once again and elect a leader for the nation instead of just picking one. However, some people are speculating MacArthur might use this power in a corrupt fashion which will lead to us becoming barely more democratic than the corporatists."
 
 
 # Events #
 
 ccc.1.t: "Our Holy Duty"
 ccc.1.d: "The revolution has returned. With the old man Rockefeller gone, the resistance is stronger than ever in control Arizona and New Mexico. Many doubted that we would be able to seize control of such a large swath of territory, but we did it. The Revolution of 1916 has returned, but it hasn't been avenged yet. We will avenge Teddy Roosevelt's Martyrdom for the Revolution. We will liberate America. We will bring back Liberty. Long Live America!"
 ccc.1.a: "MacArthur shall lead us to Victory!"
 ccc.2.t: "MacArthur Sworn in as President"
 ccc.2.d: "Information has come from the Central Command Center that Douglas MacArthur, general and leader of the remainders of the revolutionary army of 1916, has been sworn in as the President of America in Phoenix. International commentators have marked this event as a strange occurence as this is the first time a so called US president was sworn in outside of the capital and not even having been elected. MacArthur has promised to bring back democracy and freedom to America in his great speech. Whether he will actually achieve this goal of his is yet to be seen, but many see it as unlikely as of now"
 ccc.2.a: "Hail the... Chief?"
 ccc.3.t: "MacArthur requests our Integration"
 ccc.3.d: "The Government of Douglas MacArthur, which views itself as the legitimate government of the United States, has asked for our institutions and army to peacefully integrate with theirs. This will be an important choice. While we want security and peace, maybe California's destiny is different from that of the rest of America? However, ultimately, declining this offer will most likely lead to our immediate demise in a swift invasion of the Central Command Center."
 ccc.3.b: "We support you, Douglas!"
 ccc.3.a: "California will stay Independent"
 ccc.4.t: "The People and the Marshal"
 ccc.4.d: "The Marshal is known as a noble leader of an even more noble resistance. Still, some Americans question his competence and label him a terrorist for his strange methods during the last 6 years of guerilla warfare in the mountains. We must convince them otherwise. Douglas MacArthur loves the American People and he wishes all the best things for them. We must convince the American people that the marshal is a righteous leader. Otherwise, they will be the first to revolt and become radicals."
 ccc.4.a: "Support the Elderly"
 ccc.4.b: "Support the Students"
 ccc.4.c: "Support the Soldiers"
