 CCC_despotism_party: "MacArthur's Resistance"
 CCC_despotism_party_desc: "The resistance lead by the general Douglas MacArthur has its roots in the Revolution of 1916, which ended in a massacre of all American heroes who wanted to save the nation from Rockefeller's evil grasp. Now, the resistance continues its fight against the degenerate elitist regime. With the death of the sick man Rockefeller, the resistance finally breathes a bit of fresh air and dreams about reuniting America once more."

 # Focuses #
 
 USA_mc_to_save_a_nation: "To Save a Nation"
 USA_mc_to_save_a_nation_desc: "America has arisen once again. The old man Rockefeller has kicked the bucket, and with him dead his ugly regime has collapsed. The Battle Hymn of the Republic shall be heard all across America soon. We have taken control of Arizona and New Mexico. We must now reorganize our forces and get ready to win this civil war. Its an unfortunate turn of events that the country has collapsed like this, but we should look to the future and be optimistic. Our great nation will be united again under a true demoratic government and our American institutions will be restored. For Freedom!"
 USA_mc_convice_the_military: "Convince the Military"
 USA_mc_convice_the_military_desc: "The General Staff of the MacArthur Resistance is loyal to our leadership, but we will still have to convince them in our ability to restore order in America and establish a new future filled with liberty and freedom. We shall hold a meeting where MacArthur can share his ideas and convince them of his leadership prowess. Only by uniting the nation, the generals included, can we achieve national stability."
 USA_mc_secure_the_towns: "Secure the Towns"
 USA_mc_secure_the_towns_desc: "Our towns, with the takeover of the resistance militias, have seen an increase in criminality and violence. We must impose martial law in specific areas in order to be able to restore order and get the nation back on track. If we continue like this, all the businesses will close and we will have a major economic and societal crisis at our hands. We are also getting reports that Mexican immigrants are eating dogs and cats in our cities. We must immedieately crack down on their dogeating practices."
 USA_mc_rally_the_people: "Rally the American People"
 USA_mc_rally_the_people_desc: "All the other factions that are present in this country hate the people. They only seek to benefit themselves. The corporations care about money, the socialists care about pushing the marxist agenda, the KKK are just degenerates and everyone else is either irrelevant or insane. We are the only force for good in this country, and we must rally the people behind our noble cause."
 USA_mc_promise_democracy: "Promise Them Democracy!"
 USA_mc_promise_democracy_desc: "The Rockefeller regime corrupted our democratic institutions and made our people into the slaves of big corporations. We must sure this never happens again. We shall promise the people what they want: the full return of democracy and the trials of corrupt politicians influenced by the corporations. Justice will be restored to this nation, even if the radicals and the corporations don't agree. The people support us, and not them."
 USA_mc_declare_macarthur_president: "Declare MacArthur President"
 USA_mc_declare_macarthur_president_desc: "Hard times require radical measures. In order to strenghten our legitimacy, we will need to swear in Douglas MacArthur as the new president of the United States. Once America is free again, we will be able to hold real elections once again and elect a leader for the nation instead of just picking one. However, some people are speculating MacArthur might use this power in a corrupt fashion which will lead to us becoming barely more democratic than the corporatists."
 USA_mc_fixing_the_economy: "Fixing the Economy"
 USA_mc_fixing_the_economy_desc: "The assassination has provoked a series of strikes and demonstrations that shut down our economy for weeks. Even if most of the industry lied near the coast, our central region was still affected. Factories lay without their workers, and banks remain ephermally closed. The once bustling towns of Phoenix and Las Vegas, courtesy of their popularity and tourism industries, have now seen visitor numbers hit new lows, as if we were back in the Wild West."
 USA_mc_cooperate_with_loyal_corporations: "Co-operate with loyal Corporations"
 USA_mc_cooperate_with_loyal_corporations_desc: "Not every company is a branch of Ford Motors! We will search for valuable corporations willing enough to cooperate with our government and seek to invest as best as we can into them, so that our blast furnaces can fire off again!"
 USA_mc_emergency_industrialization: "Emergency Industrialisation"
 USA_mc_emergency_industrialization_desc: "We will implement a number of laws making economic reform easier as well as to open a number of new state-owned factories. For the people to find jobs we need to put more effort into creating spaces where they can get those jobs. However, we also need to take away a few liberties to speed these reforms up, but fret not, this will be temporary..."
 USA_mc_hike_the_population_tax: "Hike the Population Tax"
 USA_mc_hike_the_population_tax_desc: "A painful action, but it must be done. If we wish to keep funding our economic goals we need to gain a greater budget, and to do that is to allocate such a burden to our people, as is increasing the tax. Alas, we will come out great again!"
 USA_mc_fighting_for_democracy: "Fighting for Freedom"
 USA_mc_fighting_for_democracy_desc: "The Army of Liberation fights for freedom, democracy and the constitution. Nothing shall stop us. Not the Socialists. Not the Klansmen. Not the Corporations. We will restore America to what it used to be, the land of the free. However, it is also... the land of the brave! And our army certainly is more than brave! The Legacy of the Liberation Army will echo in all American books of history. Forward, soldiers!"
 USA_mc_declare_a_great_crusade: "Declare a Great Crusade"
 USA_mc_declare_a_great_crusade_desc: "The time has come for a crusade, a great crusade. The socialists in the north are an emminent threat. The Klansmen in the east are murdering our citizens. The Corporatists seize to bring their nightmare to the west once again. But no- they will be stopped! The Revolution of 1916 will be avenged. We will avenge our martyr Teddy Roosevelt, and in his name we will punish his killer Henry Ford. A cowardly pig, that Henry Ford guy! America shall be saved again, free again, and great again! So boys, start the crusade! We Shall Make America Great Again!"
 USA_mc_restart_trade: "Restart our Trade"
 USA_mc_restart_trade_desc: "With the collapse of the regime and the ensuing civil war for the future of America, our connections to the outside world in an economic sense have been completely cut off. We have been left mostly stranded on an island of isolation. It is time to re-establish our economic ties to our North American neighbors and the world in general in order to bring economic prosperity for all Americans."
 USA_mc_loyalty_to_democracy: "Loyalty to Democracy"
 USA_mc_loyalty_to_democracy_desc: "We remain loyal to the cause of freedom and liberty for all Americans, no matter who they are or where they are from. Democracy, as an idea, is our main agenda and will continue being so. Some people within our ranks are advocating that democracy has failed America. They are corrupt and don't realize what this nation was founded for: The American Dream! And unless we defend our constitution, there won't be no American Dream. It is our duty to make sure the Marshal hands over his power after the civil war is over."
 USA_mc_loyalty_to_the_marshal: "Loyalty to the Marshal"
 USA_mc_loyalty_to_the_marshal_desc: "The only way our nation will be prosperous and free again is if the said freedom is supported by a good, noble man. In our case, this is the great and honored marshal Douglas MacArthur. He must continue being the president for some time, even though this solution might be pragamtic or not all too well aligned with the American Constitution. But the people love their Marshal, right? What would be the problem in him being the president even some time after the civil war is over."
 USA_mc_offer_them_reunification: "Offer Them Reunification"
 USA_mc_offer_them_reunification_desc: "Instead of taking a militaristic approach in dealing with the Californians, we should seek to be diplomatic and talk with their government about their entry into the resistance. Their army should be integrated straight into the American Liberation Army and their economy connected to our offices in Phoenix. Only if we stand united will we withstand the pressure of the Rise of Radicalism."
 USA_mc_destroy_the_californian_traitors: "Destroy the Californian Traitors"
 USA_mc_destroy_the_californian_traitors_desc: "It has become clearly visible that California wants to be seperate from the union. They have actively denied all our calls and thrown out all of our diplomats. Their doctrine of independence is unacceptable. We must launch an immediate, unexpected strike which will crush the Californians and show them who's boss on the west coast."
 USA_mc_utilize_californian_oil: "Utilize California's Oil Reserves" 
 USA_mc_utilize_californian_oil_desc: "Now that we have control of California, we must use our newfound resources to fuel our economy and army. California has many oil reserves that are ready to be used by the Liberation Army and the entire world. Utilizing this opportunity and expanding our excavation will surely be profitable both militarily and economically."
 USA_mc_destroy_the_oregon_soviet: "Destroy the Oregon Soviet"
 USA_mc_destroy_the_oregon_soviet_desc: "In Oregon, a socialist revolt has happened that established a fragile communist republic. These degenerate reds must be dealt with immedieately now that we have a larger border with them. We will assemble an army and march in and capture all the important points in Oregon and make sure these rebelious workers know their place. There is no place for reds in America."
 USA_mc_increase_working_hours: "Increase Working Hours"
 USA_mc_increase_working_hours_desc: "Our production is lacking behind the one of the corporate state in the east and that of the Ford Company. If we are to liberate the American Nation from all of these radicals and totalitarians, we will need to temporarily increase working hours in order to have more goods being produced for both our people and army to consume. If we don't do this, we will immedieately fall and be a small page in the history books."
 USA_mc_import_mexican_labor: "Import Mexican Labor"
 USA_mc_import_mexican_labor_desc: "Mi Casa es tu Casa! We need to invite Mexican workers in order to boost our fragile industry that is lacking a proper workforce after the events following the assasination. We will give them visas and allow them to work here. We will promise them good food since thats what Mexicans like, but we wont give it to them. They are a cheap workforce, screws in our machine. And we will use them for America's return."
 USA_mc_wings_of_freedom: "The Wings of Freedom"
 USA_mc_wings_of_freedom_desc: "The experience of the Great War in Europe has showed that having an airforce can be very useful for achieving victories on the battlefield. The United States have been lacking in this regard as no mercenary company built their own airforce. Therefore, we should invest in building one for the Liberation Army. It will give us a big advantage over all the other groups and make achieving victory easy."
 USA_mc_expand_our_research_capabilities: "Expand our Research Capabilites"
 USA_mc_expand_our_research_capabilities_desc: "We need to expand our laboratories and invest in companies that make new products both for our military and for the civilian population. We are lacking technologically compared to the other warlords due to our geographical location. In order to fight against this, we need to heavily invest into expanding our education system, our labs and we need to support the engineers of America at being the best versions of themselves."
 USA_mc_tactical_bombardment: "Tactical Bombardment"
 USA_mc_tactical_bombardment_desc: "We must bomb the criminals that seek to destroy America to dust and include our airforce more closely to the battles on the ground. We must invest in a fleet of tactical bombers in order to be able to achieve this effect."
 USA_mc_research_new_bombers: "Research New Bombers"
 USA_mc_research_new_bombers_desc: "We must subsidize military companies that are trying to develop new bomber airplanes and then buy them from them. In order to be the victors on the ground, we need to be the most modern in the sky and quite litteraly be able to fly!"
 USA_mc_bombs_of_freedom: "The Bombs of Freedom"
 USA_mc_bombs_of_freedom_desc: "We bomb only those who threaten the freedom and security of American Citizens. The Anarchists, The Marxists, The Radicals, The Klansmen and all the other bad men that try to ruin this country from within. We will bomb their positions. We will bomb their leaders. Simons, our planes will bomb your headquarters to dust! Haywood, take care! The Bombs of Freedom are coming and you won't be able to stop them. May God help our enemies and have mercy on them, because we won't. We are sending them straight to hell, to the judgement of the most high."
 USA_mc_fight_for_air_superiority: "Fight for Air Superiority"
 USA_mc_fight_for_air_superiority_desc: "We are not the only ones who are trying to control the skies, and in order to be able to actively utilize our planes and help our soldiers on the ground, it will be neccesary to build a fleet of planes which will be able to quickly assume superiority on the skies and make sure the Airforce of Liberation comes out on top."
 USA_mc_cas_research: "Invest into Close Air Support Research"
 USA_mc_cas_research_desc: "We need to invest into the research of planes that will be able to closely support our troops on the ground and strike enemy positions at quick speeds. While not as big or harsh as tactical bombers, close air support planes will be the most effective at striking fear into the hearts of our enemies."
 USA_mc_simplify_plane_production: "Simplify Plane Production"
 USA_mc_simplify_plane_production_desc: "We need a big fleet of fighter planes in order to be able to dominate the skies, and we can't produce them unless we optimize our production lines and simplify the process of producing new planes for the Liberation Airforce to use on their missions. We must cut all the rubbish regulations that would otherwise make production harder or less effective."

 # Events #
 
 ccc.1.t: "Our Holy Duty"
 ccc.1.d: "The revolution has returned. With the old man Rockefeller gone, the resistance is stronger than ever in control Arizona and New Mexico. Many doubted that we would be able to seize control of such a large swath of territory, but we did it. The Revolution of 1916 has returned, but it hasn't been avenged yet. We will avenge Teddy Roosevelt's Martyrdom for the Revolution. We will liberate America. We will bring back Liberty. Long Live America!"
 ccc.1.a: "MacArthur shall lead us to Victory!"
 ccc.2.t: "MacArthur Sworn in as President"
 ccc.2.d: "Information has come from the Central Command Center that Douglas MacArthur, general and leader of the remainders of the revolutionary army of 1916, has been sworn in as the President of America in Phoenix. International commentators have marked this event as a strange occurence as this is the first time a so called US president was sworn in outside of the capital and not even having been elected. MacArthur has promised to bring back democracy and freedom to America in his great speech. Whether he will actually achieve this goal of his is yet to be seen, but many see it as unlikely as of now"
 ccc.2.a: "Hail the... Chief?"
 ccc.3.t: "MacArthur requests our Integration"
 ccc.3.d: "The Government of Douglas MacArthur, which views itself as the legitimate government of the United States, has asked for our institutions and army to peacefully integrate with theirs. This will be an important choice. While we want security and peace, maybe California's destiny is different from that of the rest of America? However, ultimately, declining this offer will most likely lead to our immediate demise in a swift invasion of the Central Command Center."
 ccc.3.b: "We support you, Douglas!"
 ccc.3.a: "California will stay Independent"
 ccc.4.t: "The People and the Marshal"
 ccc.4.d: "The Marshal is known as a noble leader of an even more noble resistance. Still, some Americans question his competence and label him a terrorist for his strange methods during the last 6 years of guerilla warfare in the mountains. We must convince them otherwise. Douglas MacArthur loves the American People and he wishes all the best things for them. We must convince the American people that the marshal is a righteous leader. Otherwise, they will be the first to revolt and become radicals."
 ccc.4.a: "Support the Elderly"
 ccc.4.b: "Support the Students"
 ccc.4.c: "Support the Soldiers"
 ccc.5.t: "MacArthur's Government Demands Our Loyalty"
 ccc.5.d: "The President Douglas MacArthur has requested that we rejoin the union and lay down our arms. How shall we respond?"
 ccc.5.a: "Let's rejoin the Union"
 ccc.5.b: "There is nothing we can do."
