 TEX_destroy_the_corporatocracy: "Destroy The Corporations"
 TEX_destroy_the_corporatocracy_desc: "These corporations and businessmen are all the same. They want to take away the money of the people through slavery, usury and all the other sins of the book. We, as America's defenders cannot accept this. We cannot let out people ever be slaves to these evil men in suits. It is our duty to forcefully dismantle all the minor corporations present in our controlled states and to make sure the monopolies which existed during the Rockefeller Regime never show up again and haunt the American people."
 TEX_intervene_in_the_economy: "Seize Corporate Assets"
 TEX_intervene_in_the_economy_desc: "We cannot just tell these companies to stop treating people like trash. We need to force them do so. Unfortunately, while this practice might be viewed criticlaly by some economists and politcians, as a country we will need to switch to a more interventionist economic system for the time being with a big amount of state control never seen in American history. But as they say: Radical times require radical measures"
 TEX_develop_our_infrastructure_desc: "We must connect the American nation. The old backward system of infrastructure and roads ultimately led to the failure of the Revolution of 1916 because the cells werent able to actively support one another which enabled the more decentralized corporate militias to destroy our attempt. However, we won't allow this to happen. In order to boost the growth of our economy and our military we will need to reform the roads."
 TEX_develop_our_infrastructure: "Develop our Infrastructure"
 TEX_raise_corporate_taxes: "Raise the Corporate Tax"
 TEX_raise_corporate_taxes_desc: "We need money, and we cannot overburden the people even more. They have been actively opressed and forced into uninsitutional slavery by the old tax laws which made the citizens pay amounts that are way too high. Instead, in order to get more money and to weaken the corporate grip at the same time, we will increase the corporate tax which will be a very beneficial policy long time."
 TEX_principles_of_autarky: "Principles of Autarky"
 TEX_principles_of_autarky_desc: "We need to be independent. Our resources need to come from our own excavation sites and not from Canada, Britain or any other country around the world. We need to have control over our own economy and independence in the economic sense more than ever before."
 TEX_expand_the_military_industry: "Expand the Military Industry"
 TEX_expand_the_military_industry_desc: "In order to be able to continue to fight for the future of America, we will need a strong military industry in order to produce all the guns, artillery and other equipment we will need. We must invest a major part of this year's budget into this in order to stand tall over the rest of the traitors who betrayed this nation."
 TEX_expand_worker_rights: "Expand Worker Rights"
 TEX_expand_worker_rights_desc: "The tyranical maniac John D. Rockefeller opressed the workers and regular folk of America for far too long. We will allow the workers more rights at their workplaces and in decision-making so that we can finally free them from the chains, which will also help to prevent them from falling to ideologies like marxism and anarchism."
 TEX_token_worker_rights: "Token Worker Rights"
 TEX_token_worker_rights_desc: "We must make the workers of America see that we want the best of them without actually giving them so much rights that they would destroy the economy with their own intentions and desires of so called liberation. Therefore, we will make a small show of humanity by increasing their abilities at the worker place but in a very limited amount. The goal of this is to prevent their fall to ideologies like marxism."
 TEX_develop_our_resources: "Develop our Resource Excavation"
 TEX_develop_our_resources_desc: "A modern economy is highly based on the resources needed to support the production lines which end up making all the neccesities for the average citizen. It is our economical and lawful duty to expand our excavation capabilities in order to be able to produce both consumer goods for our people and for the military."
 TEX_fight_poverty: "Fight Poverty"
 TEX_fight_poverty_desc: "The Rockefeller Administration caused poverty to rapidly rise across America. We must mitigate the effects of this by providing our people with housing and all the other neccesities for life such as food. Food should be a right for every human, no matter their status. We must establish formal welfae programs to fight this evil trend."
 TEX_agricultural_revitalization_program: "Start an Agricultural Revitalization Program"
 TEX_agricultural_revitalization_program_desc: "Americans are hungry and they need to be fed what they want, therefore we must expand our farming capabilities and make sure the farmers are satisfied with their pay and gain."
 TEX_be_resourceful: "Be Resourceful"
 TEX_be_resourceful_desc: "We don't have the money to expand our resource capabilities. Instead, we should learn to use our resources carefully to our advantage and recycle what is left of them during production stages of our equipment."
 TEX_deficit_spending: "Deficit Spending"
 TEX_deficit_spending_desc: "We need to spend some money from our reserves and invest it straight into our economy. That's just the truth. If we are too selfish, we will lack behind the others."
 TEX_fight_our_debt: "Fight our Debt"
 TEX_fight_our_debt_desc: "Due to the economic catastrophe of the Rockefeller Administration, our people have been robbed with usury and our state has been put into a cage due to our rising debt and houses of living. We need to pay back parts of our debts or make deals with the loan givers."
 TEX_fixing_the_economy: "Restrengthening Our Economy"
 TEX_fixing_the_economy_desc: "Rockefeller's administration has severely weakened our economy. We are still way better off than some of the other warlords, but we need to rebuild and regain our strength if we hope to survive."
 TEX_cooperate_with_loyal_corporations: "Control The Corporations"
 TEX_cooperate_with_loyal_corporations_desc: "Not every company is a branch of Ford Motors! We will search for valuable corporations willing enough to cooperate with our government and seek to invest as best as we can into them, so that our blast furnaces can fire off again!"
 TEX_emergency_industrialization: "Emergency Industrialisation"
 TEX_emergency_industrialization_desc: "We will implement a number of laws making economic reform easier as well as to open a number of new state-owned factories. For the people to find jobs we need to put more effort into creating spaces where they can get those jobs. However, we also need to take away a few liberties to speed these reforms up, but fret not, this will be temporary..."
 TEX_hike_the_population_tax: "Hike the Population Tax"
 TEX_hike_the_population_tax_desc: "A painful action, but it must be done. If we wish to keep funding our economic goals we need to gain a greater budget, and to do that is to allocate such a burden to our people, as is increasing the tax. Alas, we will come out great again!"
 TEX_increase_working_hours: "Mandatory Labor"
 TEX_increase_working_hours_desc: ""
 TEX_import_mexican_labor: "Import Mexican Labor"
 TEX_import_mexican_labor_desc: "Mi Casa es tu Casa! We need to invite Mexican workers in order to boost our fragile industry that is lacking a proper workforce after the events following the assasination. We will give them visas and allow them to work here. We will promise them good food since thats what Mexicans like, but we wont give it to them. They are a cheap workforce, screws in our machine. And we will use them for America's return."
 TEX_expand_our_research_capabilities: "Expand our Research Capabilites"
 TEX_expand_our_research_capabilities_desc: "We need to expand our laboratories and invest in companies that make new products both for our military and for the civilian population. We are lacking technologically compared to the other warlords due to our geographical location. In order to fight against this, we need to heavily invest into expanding our education system, our labs and we need to support the engineers of America at being the best versions of themselves."
 TEX_restart_trade: "Restart our Trade"
 TEX_restart_trade_desc: "With the collapse of the regime and the ensuing civil war for the future of America, our connections to the outside world in an economic sense have been completely cut off.
