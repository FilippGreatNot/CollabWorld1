 TEX_destroy_the_corporatocracy_desc: "These corporations and businessmen are all the same. They want to take away the money of the people through slavery, usury and all the other sins of the book. We, as America's defenders cannot accept this. We cannot let out people ever be slaves to these evil men in suits. It is our duty to forcefully dismantle all the minor corporations present in our controlled states and to make sure the monopolies which existed during the Rockefeller Regime never show up again and haunt the American people."
 TEX_intervene_in_the_economy: "Intervene in the Economy"
 TEX_intervene_in_the_economy_desc: "We cannot just tell these companies to stop treating people like trash. We need to force them do so. Unfortunately, while this practice might be viewed criticlaly by some economists and politcians, as a country we will need to switch to a more interventionist economic system for the time being with a big amount of state control never seen in American history. But as they say: Radical times require radical measures"
 TEX_develop_our_infrastructure_desc: "We must connect the American nation. The old backward system of infrastructure and roads ultimately led to the failure of the Revolution of 1916 because the cells werent able to actively support one another which enabled the more decentralized corporate militias to destroy our attempt. However, we won't allow this to happen. In order to boost the growth of our economy and our military we will need to reform the roads."

 TEX_raise_corporate_taxes: "Raise the Corporate Tax"

 TEX_expand_worker_rights: "Expand Worker Rights"
 TEX_expand_worker_rights_desc: "The tyranical maniac John D. Rockefeller opressed the workers and regular folk of America for far too long.

 TEX_token_worker_rights: "Token Worker Rights"
 TEX_token_worker_rights_desc: "We must make the workers of America see that we want the best of them without actually giving them so much rights that they would destroy the economy with their own intentions and desires of so called liberation.

 TEX_fight_poverty: "Fight Poverty"
 TEX_fight_poverty_desc: "The Rockefeller Administration caused poverty to rapidly rise across America.

 TEX_fight_our_debt_desc: "Due to the economic catastrophe of the Rockefeller Administration, our people have been robbed with usury and our state has been put into a cage due to our rising debt and houses of living. We need to pay back parts of our debts or make deals with the loan givers."
 TEX_fixing_the_economy: "Fixing the Economy"
 TEX_fixing_the_economy_desc: "The assassination has provoked a series of strikes and demonstrations that shut down our economy for weeks.

 TEX_hike_the_population_tax: "Hike the Population Tax"
 TEX_hike_the_population_tax_desc: "A painful action, but it must be done. If we wish to keep funding our economic goals we need to gain a greater budget, and to do that is to allocate such a burden to our people, as is increasing the tax. Alas, we will come out great again!"
 TEX_increase_working_hours: "Increase Working Hours"
 TEX_increase_working_hours_desc: "Our production is lacking behind the one of the corporate state in the east and that of the Ford Company. If we are to liberate the American Nation from all of these radicals and totalitarians, we will need to temporarily increase working hours in order to have more goods being produced for both our people and army to consume.
