 USA_BOOKMARK_DESC: "Since the Election of 1912, America hasn't been the same. John D. Rockefeller, also known as the richest man in the world, secured the presidency with the support of the Democrats. In the next 10 years, America would be changed as a nation in its core. The Election of 1916, in which Rockefeller decided to run with his own party, was a very close one. Rockefeller's slight victory was met with a popular revolution lead by Teddy Roosevelt, who got killed in the events by the mercenaries of Henry Ford. After this revolution, the military was disbanded, and America truly became an oppresive corporate state."

 ### Events ### 
 usa_collapse.1.t: "John D. Rockfeller assassinated!"
 usa_collapse.1.d: "President of the United States John. D Rockfeller, also known as the richest man in the world, was assasinated this morning while driving to a business meeting in Atlanta. His driver made a wrong turn into an abandoned street. Unfortunately for the president a disgruntled mine worker, who was also revealed to be a member of a socialist paramilitary, was sitting nearby armed with a gun. When he realized what was happening, he shot right into Rockfellers face. The driver suceeded in escaping the scene and the worker was executed. This event is rather ironic, since the Corporate President recently passed an act reducing mining workers rights. One thing is for certain though: this day will be writen about in the future as the day that changed America forever."
 usa_collapse.1.a: "A day to remember"
 usa_collapse.15.t: "Rockefeller Jr. Suceeds his Father"
 usa_collapse.15.d: "With the tragic death of our president John D. Rockefeller, now we need a new president for the United States. For this task we pick his son, who was his Vice President and supported him since the Elections of 1916 which also resulted in the Revolution of 1916. With his experience, the Son will finish the legacy of his father. One of the immediate tasks at hand is to stabilize America. There are riots and violence on the streets and the country is on the brink of a total civil war. Many are doubting Rockefeller Jr's ability to make the country survive these troubling times, but we sure hope he does. Not that... we really care about America... but it wouldn't be optimal financially."
 usa_collapse.15.a: "The President is Dead, Long live the President!"
 usa_collapse.2.t: "The IWW Revolts against the Regime"
 usa_collapse.2.d: "We have gotten news that the workers across cities in the mideast have organized themselves and launched a full-fledged revolution against our government. The country is starting to collapse and a civil war is inevitabile. There is nothing we can do except sit and watch the country crumble to pieces. Maybe the Workers Cause is the right one to be fighting for? "
 usa_collapse.2.b: "For the Second American Revolution!"
 usa_collapse.2.a: "There is nothing we can do."
 usa_collapse.5.t: "Ford Cuts Contacts"
 usa_collapse.5.d: "Henry Ford, the most powerful man in America behind our former president John D. Rockefeller, has been insulted by the fact he didn't end up being the next leader of our nation. He has cut all contacts from the central government and his feared mercenaries have seized a massive part of many US states. He is now an enemy of the state, but was his hypothesis really so wrong? Maybe he should be the leader of this country."
 usa_collapse.5.a: "He will pay for this"
 usa_collapse.5.b: "His cause is the right one."
 usa_collapse.8.t: "The Southern Catastrophe"
 usa_collapse.8.d: "The militias of the Ku Klux Klan, a racist organization that commited violence during the previous years, have started a revolt as well. They have seized most of the south and are preparing to do crimes against humanity in their lands. They have declared the Visible Empire of the Second Ku Klux Klan. Their loyalty lies to their cult and not to our governemnt, as they have clearly shown. They must pay the price for their treachery."
 usa_collapse.8.a: "What a Savage Cult!"
 usa_collapse.8.b: "For the Empire!"
 usa_collapse.11.t: "The Rise of the Resistance"
 usa_collapse.11.d: "A movement has quickly assembled to fight the KKK's empire mostly made up of African Americans. They have seized control of Florida and seek to wage a war for the liberation of the Black People. They talk against segragation and against the KKK, which they call the Great Satan. Maybe their ideas of liberation are worthwhile? Perhaps, the best and most noble thing to do would be to rise up against the oppresive KKK. "
 usa_collapse.11.a: "We will stay out of this."
 usa_collapse.11.b: "DEATH TO THE KU KLUX KLAN"
 usa_collapse.9.t: "Texas Declares Independence"
 usa_collapse.9.d: "The Pro-Resistance Governor of Texas who was suspected to funnel money to the MacArthur Movement has informed the rest of the nation Texas is seceding from the Union and establishing their own democracy. He has said that he was said to do such a thing, but it was neccesary to protect his people from the vile corporatists in Washington. He is a traitor to this nation now. He is no better than Theodor Roosevelt or his little Fanboy Douglas MacArthur! In fact, people are suspecting MacArthur's resistance is about to launch a massive operation as well."
 usa_collapse.9.a: "This is bad."
 usa_collapse.9.b: "For the Texan Republic!"
 usa_collapse.12.t: "California Declares Independence"
 usa_collapse.12.d: "After Texas, California has declared its independence from the Union as well. The situation in the country is becoming tense. A civil war can't be prevented anymore. Even in the regions we have soldified our control in, revolts and riots are happening. America is about to fall, and we might fall with it if we are not careful enough. Inform the mercenaries to prepare to kill everyone who attempts to touch the president. Barricade the White House!"
 usa_collapse.12.b: "For California!"
 usa_collapse.12.a: "Protect the President!"
 usa_collapse.3.t: "MacArthur Launches a Major Operation"
 usa_collapse.3.d: "One of the former low-ranking generals before the Revolution of 1916 formed a resistance by using its remnants. He has been a major thorn in our side so far and now he has launched a massive military operation where his soldiers rushed from the mountains in the cities in the Midwest. This has lead to the entire region being under his effective control. There is really nothing we can do about this anymore. Our government in the East is practically non-existant."
 usa_collapse.3.a: "We will stop this revolution too"
 usa_collapse.3.b: "We must avenge Teddy Roosevelt!"
 usa_collapse.6.t: "The Masons Seize Pennsylvania!"
 usa_collapse.6.d: "One of our more soldified states has broken away as well, and this time not as an independent republic but instead it has been taken by the Grand Masonic Lodge, one of the most evil movements in America! Our Former President used to tolerate them, but it seems this was one of his worst mistakes... They are about to wreak havoc on the northeast. The situation is tense."
 usa_collapse.6.a: "This is getting out of control"
 usa_collapse.6.b: "We are the New Saviors of America!"
 usa_collapse.14.t: "Socialist Revolution in Oregon"
 usa_collapse.14.d: "The next state on the list of breakaways is Oregon, in which surprisingly, a communist leader has seized control. This revolt means we are nearly cut off from the sea in the west. If Seattle falls, we will lose control of the entirety of this region. If this happens, our government will only remain active in the west."
 usa_collapse.14.b: "For the Oregon Soviet!"
 usa_collapse.14.a: "WHO ELSE WANTS TO BREAK AWAY?"
 usa_collapse.17.t: "The Fall of Seattle"
 usa_collapse.17.d: "Now our last port in the west has fallen. The State of Washington has also declared their independence from the Union. The situation looks extremely bleak. Maybe our own government will fall? We have to reinforce the White House even more and put troops on our borders. A frontline against the socialists and the Ku Klux Klan must be established. There is nothing we can do."
 usa_collapse.17.a: "This is bad."
 usa_collapse.17.b: "For Washington!"
 usa_collapse.16.t: "The Mormon Revolution"
 usa_collapse.16.d: "With the power vacuum in the west being bigger than ever, the Mormon Church has seized control of Idaho and now leads a theocratic mormon regime. This marks the end of our government in the West completely. We must make sure no further states breakaway, however the situation in New England and New York remains tense. Maybe we can survive? Probably not."
 usa_collapse.16.a: "Heretics."
 usa_collapse.16.b: "For the Mormon Church!"
 usa_collapse.13.a: "As if it couldn't get any worse..."
 usa_collapse.13.b: "Sail to Alaska"
 usa_collapse.13.t: "Alaska Breaks Away"
 usa_collapse.13.d: "Alaska is the state many people consider to be the most evil place in America. Here, the Natives were put into reservations which were actually concentration camps and they were forced to work for the good of the oil companies. Now, these same oil companies have decided to take Alaska out of the union. However, maybe the Natives can launch a revolt?"
 usa_collapse.7.t: "New York breaks away"
 usa_collapse.7.d: "Now even the City of New York has declared independence from the union. This is the closest revolt we have had to the capital. It is very possible our entire government will collapse at this point. It pretty much has already, if we are willing to be honest. It surely can't get any worse than this?"
 usa_collapse.7.a: "Well..."
 usa_collapse.7.b: "For New York!"
 usa_collapse.4.t: "New England Says Goodbye"
 usa_collapse.4.d: "Now even New England has decided to try their luck and leave the union under the leadership of Calvin Cooldige. What can we even do at this point? This country has been broken into pieces by these woke moralists. However, not everything is bleak. The rest of the country is soldified, we should be able to hold what we have currently. It is unlikely any more land will fall to these rebels. We must reform and retake the country, but this will take time. For the President!"
 usa_collapse.4.a: "The Last Revolt"
 usa_collapse.4.b: "For New England!"
 usa_collapse.18.t: "Panama Captures the Canal"
 usa_collapse.18.d: "Terrible news have come from the Panaman Canal. The government of Panama saw our weakness and decided to just take the Canal from us. This is a major violation of our rights in the region but there is unfortunately nothing we can do about this."
 usa_collapse.18.a: "We are fucked."
 usa_collapse.20.t: "The Second American Civil War"
 usa_collapse.20.d: "With the United States collapsed into multiple rebellious fronts and warlord states fighting for power, the era of the Second American Civil War has begun. This is a terrible event for all people involved. Thousands of civilians have lost their lives in the conflict already. Will America be able to find unity again or will it collapse as a nation like many empires of the past?"
 usa_collapse.20.a: "Rockefeller's Legacy"

 rockefeller.1.d: "For 10 years, our nation has been under the rule of John D. Rockefeller. Now that he has unfortunately passed away we will pass the presidency on to his son who was also the acting vice-president. What has happened has happened. The collapse was the fault of the bolshevik degenerates, the woke moralists and all the other rebels who fought against our noble president. Now, Jr. will continue his legacy and lead this country to financial success. These hard times will be more than hard, but eventually we will come back stronger than ever, richer than ever!

 ### Focuses ###
 USA_rockfeller_america: "Rockfeller's America"
 USA_rockfeller_america_desc: "Ever since securing victory in the Election of 1912, John D. Rockefeller's Regime has transformed America into a new nation. Once thought to be a candidate of reform and progress, he has proven that he is everything but not that. The Rockefeller Administration has revamped American Society into a machine. All the democratic institutions in the country have been destroyed. The politicians in the Senate and in the House of Representatives are servants of corporations. The 1916 Revolution sealed this fate even further when it was harshly supressed by the regime and the US Armed Forces were pretty much disbanded. The violence caused by the consequences of the revolution resulted in the 1920 elections being suspended, and a literal corporate dictatorship arising to take the place of the old democracy. Now, it remains to be seen what will become of this once proud nation."
 USA_industrial_nation: "No Weekends!"
 USA_industrial_nation_desc: "The American Economic Machine is not powerful enough just yet. In order to boost our economic growth by a large margin, we should cut all public holidays and shorten the weekends for most employees. Of course, the work on the weekends won't be paid with more money. Instead, we will pay even less for the work hours on the weekend. The growth must continue, and the workers are the gears of the growth of our businesses and of the general American nation. What is best for the big corporations is ultimately the best for the population of the country. Once we realize this truth, we will be unstoppable."
 USA_ban_communist_parties: "Ban all Socialist Parties"
 USA_ban_communist_parties_desc: "Because of the failure of the Republican-Democrat Coalition to retake the country during the Revolution of 1916, new movements have formed to try and take down the regime and even liberate the American workers in general. One of these are the socialists who have been the biggest threat for the regime, especially during the Christmas riots a few days ago. It is evident that this movement must be destroyed in order to ensure security for the regime and in order to keep the money flowing. The International Workers of the World, as they call themselves, must be shot in the leg. Through a ban of all of the socialist parties that exist in America, we will be able to finally end this mischievous band. Surely, after this move, they won't come back to threaten the life of our president ever again!"
 USA_polarize_the_public: "Polarize the American Public"
 USA_polarize_the_public_desc: "There is no better way to keep a population from revolting other than turning them against each other. We will make everyone blame the other party, while we are the real perpetrators of their destruction. The Racists will blame the Communists, and the Communists will blame the Racists. The Democrats will blame the Republicans, and the Republicans will blame the Democrats. This way we will make sure that no one realizes our true plans for the American Economy. They will be blind like sheep in flocks, fighting one another. Divide and Conquer, as they say. Rockefeller knows how to make the best of every situation and how to keep the nation at bay."
 USA_cut_taxes: "Cut Corporate Taxes"
 USA_cut_taxes_desc: "Taxes are a myth at this point, except for the workers. They have been reduced so much for the corporations that at this point, they are irrelevant to the general government budget. And do we need a budget? Not really. Our military is in the hands of the brave corporate men who lead this nation forward. The Workers do not need health insurance nor social security, the prosperity of the nation will grant it for them instead. Now, we will make the taxes so marginal that no one will even think about the risks of commiting tax fraud. Why would they commit tax fraud over a 1% corporate tax rate? They wouldn't. Of course, to make ends meet, we will raise the taxes for the workers in order to be able to finance our economic growth even further. This is the best for them too anyways."
 USA_up_yours: "Up Yours Woke Moralists!"
 USA_up_yours_desc: "THESE STUPID MORALISTS. They think OUR GOVERNMENT has no morals? How dare they suggest such a vile thing! Our interests are only with the men and women of this country. How dare they lie about our great nation! Anyone who dares to say that there is no freedom of speech WILL BE KILLED for what they said! No woke moralist will escape our grasp. The socialists, the journalists, all of the band! They will all be imprisoned or worse! YOU WILL PAY FOR YOUR TREACHERY! UP YOURS!"
 USA_maximize_growth: "Maximize Economic Growth"
 USA_maximize_growth_desc: "We will make sure that this nation grows, regardless of the things we have to do in order to achieve this. MAXIMIZE ALL ECONOMIC GROWTH! We will be the greatest financial empire this world has ever seen in ALL OF HISTORY! Cut all the corporate taxes, stop any social spending! All will go into building new factories and roads for the betterment of our economy. This is the only thing we have to focus on. It will pay off and bring prosperity to the American workers too. Sell off all our guns to foreign states! We don't need them no more. We will buy the entire world. There is nothing that can stop the power of money! Hail the Chief!"
 USA_american_dream: "The Capitalist Dream"
 USA_american_dream_desc: "We have achieved everything we wanted! America is now the greatest nation on the planet for the Businessman! Money is flowing like never before. Every Man will be Rich in America! This is the land of dreams. The Capitalist Dream will never end from now on. Everybody will be rich and will be able to open their own business. The people are happy, the corporations are happy! There is nothing that can stop the Destiny of our nation. Manifest the Economy! Make sure everyone makes their very own business! FOR MONEY!

 ### Ideas ###
 USA_unstable_nation: "The Scars of 1916"
 USA_unstable_nation_desc: "In 1916, after Rockefeller left the Democrats, a coalition was formed between the Republicans and the Democrats in order to try to get John D. Rockefeller out of the white house. They chose Teddy Roosevelt to be their presidential candidate, and the election sure was close. However, through faking votes and a massive propaganda campaign, Rockefeller kept onto power. The nation broke down. The Republican-Democrat Coalition was outraged and people started rioting on the streets. There was bloodshed and a literal front was starting to form. It all looked like a civil war. However, in the decisive Battle of Mineapolis Teddy Roosevelt was killed by Ford's Mercenaries, and the rest of the revolution was quickly harshly supressed. This year was a hard one, and the American population still has their martyr in memory."
 
 USA_alaskan_concentration_camps: "Alaskan Concetration Camps"
 USA_alaskan_concentration_camps_desc: "We have tried to make use of every person in this country for the greater good of the businesses in America, since who doesn't love money? A move of the Rockefeller's administration that happened 2 years ago was putting nearly all the native populations of America in labor camps in Alaska. This was done in order to utilize their physical force in order to urbanize the region. However, a resistance is forming in the camps and people are getting worried. Could this policy eventually backfire?"
