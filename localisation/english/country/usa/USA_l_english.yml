USA_BOOKMARK_DESC: "Since the Election of 1912, America hasn't been the same. John D. Rockefeller, also known as the richest man in the world, secured the presidency with the support of the Democrats. In the next 10 years, America would be changed as a nation in its core. The Election of 1916, in which Rockefeller decided to run with his own party, was a very close one. Rockefeller's slight victory was met with a popular revolution lead by Teddy Roosevelt, who got killed in the events by the mercenaries of Henry Ford. After this revolution, the military was disbanded, and America truly became an oppresive corporate state."

usa_collapse.1.t: "John D. Rockefeller assassinated!"
usa_collapse.1.d: "President of the United States John. D Rockefeller, also known as the richest man in the world, was assasinated this morning while driving to a business meeting in Atlanta. His driver made a wrong turn into an abandoned street. Unfortunately for the president a disgruntled mine worker, who was also revealed to be a member of a socialist paramilitary, was sitting nearby armed with a gun. When he realized what was happening, he shot right into Rockefellers face. The driver suceeded in escaping the scene and the worker was executed. This event is rather ironic, since the Corporate President recently passed an act reducing mining workers rights. One thing is for certain though: this day will be writen about in the future as the day that changed America forever."
usa_collapse.1.a: "A day to remember"
usa_collapse.15.t: "Rockefeller Jr. Suceeds his Father"
usa_collapse.15.d: "With the tragic death of our president John D. Rockefeller, now we need a new president for the United States. For this task we pick his son, who was his Vice President and supported him since the Elections of 1916 which also resulted in the Revolution of 1916. With his experience, the Son will finish the legacy of his father. One of the immediate tasks at hand is to stabilize America. There are riots and violence on the streets and the country is on the brink of a total civil war. Many are doubting Rockefeller Jr's ability to make the country survive these troubling times, but we sure hope he does. Not that... we really care about America... but it wouldn't be optimal financially."
usa_collapse.15.a: "The President is Dead, Long live the President!"
usa_collapse.2.t: "The IWW Revolts against the Regime"
usa_collapse.2.d: "We have gotten news that the workers across cities in the mideast have organized themselves and launched a full-fledged revolution against our government. The country is starting to collapse and a civil war is inevitabile. There is nothing we can do except sit and watch the country crumble to pieces. Maybe the Workers Cause is the right one to be fighting for? "
usa_collapse.2.b: "For the Second American Revolution!"
usa_collapse.2.a: "There is nothing we can do."
usa_collapse.5.t: "Ford Cuts Contacts"
usa_collapse.5.d: "Henry Ford, the most powerful man in America behind our former president John D. Rockefeller, has been insulted by the fact he didn't end up being the next leader of our nation. He has cut all contacts from the central government and his feared mercenaries have seized a massive part of many US states. He is now an enemy of the state, but was his hypothesis really so wrong? Maybe he should be the leader of this country."
usa_collapse.5.a: "He will pay for this"
usa_collapse.5.b: "His cause is the right one."
usa_collapse.8.t: "The Southern Catastrophe"
usa_collapse.8.d: "The militias of the Ku Klux Klan, a racist organization that commited violence during the previous years, have started a revolt as well. They have seized most of the south and are preparing to do crimes against humanity in their lands. They have declared the Visible Empire of the Second Ku Klux Klan. Their loyalty lies to their cult and not to our governemnt, as they have clearly shown. They must pay the price for their treachery."
usa_collapse.8.a: "What a Savage Cult!"
usa_collapse.8.b: "For the Empire!"
usa_collapse.11.t: "The Rise of the Resistance"
usa_collapse.11.d: "A movement has quickly assembled to fight the KKK's empire mostly made up of African Americans. They have seized control of Florida and seek to wage a war for the liberation of the Black People. They talk against segragation and against the KKK, which they call the Great Satan. Maybe their ideas of liberation are worthwhile? Perhaps, the best and most noble thing to do would be to rise up against the oppresive KKK. "
usa_collapse.11.a: "We will stay out of this."
usa_collapse.11.b: "DEATH TO THE KU KLUX KLAN"
usa_collapse.9.t: "Texas Declares Independence"
usa_collapse.9.d: "The Pro-Resistance Governor of Texas who was suspected to funnel money to the MacArthur Movement has informed the rest of the nation Texas is seceding from the Union and establishing their own democracy. He has said that he was said to do such a thing, but it was neccesary to protect his people from the vile corporatists in Washington. He is a traitor to this nation now. He is no better than Theodor Roosevelt or his little Fanboy Douglas MacArthur! In fact, people are suspecting MacArthur's resistance is about to launch a massive operation as well."
usa_collapse.9.a: "This is bad."
usa_collapse.9.b: "For the Texan Republic!"
usa_collapse.12.t: "California Declares Independence"
usa_collapse.12.d: "After Texas, California has declared its independence from the Union as well. The situation in the country is becoming tense. A civil war can't be prevented anymore. Even in the regions we have soldified our control in, revolts and riots are happening. America is about to fall, and we might fall with it if we are not careful enough. Inform the mercenaries to prepare to kill everyone who attempts to touch the president. Barricade the White House!"
usa_collapse.12.b: "For California!"
usa_collapse.12.a: "Protect the President!"
usa_collapse.3.t: "MacArthur Launches a Major Operation"
usa_collapse.3.d: "One of the former low-ranking generals before the Revolution of 1916 formed a resistance by using its remnants. He has been a major thorn in our side so far and now he has launched a massive military operation where his soldiers rushed from the mountains in the cities in the Midwest. This has lead to the entire region being under his effective control. There is really nothing we can do about this anymore. Our government in the East is practically non-existant."
usa_collapse.3.a: "We will stop this revolution too"
usa_collapse.3.b: "We must avenge Teddy Roosevelt!"
usa_collapse.6.t: "The Masons Seize Pennsylvania!"
usa_collapse.6.d: "One of our more soldified states has broken away as well, and this time not as an independent republic but instead it has been taken by the Grand Masonic Lodge, one of the most evil movements in America! Our Former President used to tolerate them, but it seems this was one of his worst mistakes... They are about to wreak havoc on the northeast. The situation is tense."
usa_collapse.6.a: "This is getting out of control"
usa_collapse.6.b: "We are the New Saviors of America!"
usa_collapse.14.t: "Socialist Revolution in Oregon"
usa_collapse.14.d: "The next state on the list of breakaways is Oregon, in which surprisingly, a communist leader has seized control. This revolt means we are nearly cut off from the sea in the west. If Seattle falls, we will lose control of the entirety of this region. If this happens, our government will only remain active in the west."
usa_collapse.14.b: "For the Oregon Soviet!"
usa_collapse.14.a: "WHO ELSE WANTS TO BREAK AWAY?"
usa_collapse.17.t: "The Fall of Seattle"
usa_collapse.17.d: "Now our last port in the west has fallen. The State of Washington has also declared their independence from the Union. The situation looks extremely bleak. Maybe our own government will fall? We have to reinforce the White House even more and put troops on our borders. A frontline against the socialists and the Ku Klux Klan must be established. There is nothing we can do."
usa_collapse.17.a: "This is bad."
usa_collapse.17.b: "For Washington!"
usa_collapse.16.t: "The Mormon Revolution"
usa_collapse.16.d: "With the power vacuum in the west being bigger than ever, the Mormon Church has seized control of Idaho and now leads a theocratic mormon regime. This marks the end of our government in the West completely. We must make sure no further states breakaway, however the situation in New England and New York remains tense. Maybe we can survive? Probably not."
usa_collapse.16.a: "Heretics."
usa_collapse.16.b: "For the Mormon Church!"
usa_collapse.13.a: "As if it couldn't get any worse..."
usa_collapse.13.b: "Sail to Alaska"
usa_collapse.13.t: "Alaska Breaks Away"
usa_collapse.13.d: "Alaska is the state many people consider to be the most evil place in America. Here, the Natives were put into reservations which were actually concentration camps and they were forced to work for the good of the oil companies. Now, these same oil companies have decided to take Alaska out of the union. However, maybe the Natives can launch a revolt?"
usa_collapse.7.t: "New York breaks away"
usa_collapse.7.d: "Now even the City of New York has declared independence from the union. This is the closest revolt we have had to the capital. It is very possible our entire government will collapse at this point. It pretty much has already, if we are willing to be honest. It surely can't get any worse than this?"
usa_collapse.7.a: "Well..."
usa_collapse.7.b: "For New York!"
usa_collapse.4.t: "New England Says Goodbye"
usa_collapse.4.d: "Now even New England has decided to try their luck and leave the union under the leadership of Calvin Cooldige. What can we even do at this point? This country has been broken into pieces by these woke moralists. However, not everything is bleak. The rest of the country is soldified, we should be able to hold what we have currently. It is unlikely any more land will fall to these rebels. We must reform and retake the country, but this will take time. For the President!"
usa_collapse.4.a: "The Last Revolt"
usa_collapse.4.b: "For New England!"
usa_collapse.18.t: "Panama Captures the Canal"
usa_collapse.18.d: "Terrible news have come from the Panaman Canal. The government of Panama saw our weakness and decided to just take the Canal from us. This is a major violation of our rights in the region but there is unfortunately nothing we can do about this."
usa_collapse.18.a: "We are fucked."
usa_collapse.20.t: "The Second American Civil War"
usa_collapse.20.d: "With the United States collapsed into multiple rebellious fronts and warlord states fighting for power, the era of the Second American Civil War has begun. This is a terrible event for all people involved. Thousands of civilians have lost their lives in the conflict already. Will America be able to find unity again or will it collapse as a nation like many empires of the past?"
usa_collapse.20.a: "Rockefeller's Legacy"
rockefeller.1.t: "The Father's Son"
rockefeller.1.d: "For 10 years, our nation has been under the rule of John D. Rockefeller. Now that he has unfortunately passed away we will pass the presidency on to his son who was also the acting vice-president. What has happened has happened. The collapse was the fault of the bolshevik degenerates, the woke moralists and all the other rebels who fought against our noble president. Now, Jr. will continue his legacy and lead this country to financial success. These hard times will be more than hard, but eventually we will come back stronger than ever, richer than ever! Long live Rockefeller Jr.!"

usa_rockefeller_jr.1.t: "Meeting with the Oligarchs"
usa_rockefeller_jr.1.d: "Yesterday, the president held a meeting with many powerful men across our territories. Oil barons, factory owners, and so on. Together, they approached him with a proposal to invest in expanding the industrial sector in Kentucky, a state which is lacking and according to them, has a lot of potential. However, many in our administration oppose this idea of delegating millions of US dollars from the treasury to such a project while our country is quite litteraly collapsing. It might be smarter to save the funds for other projects. What do you say, Mr. President?"
usa_rockefeller_jr.1.a: "We Accept the Proposal."
usa_rockefeller_jr.1.b: "We don't have the money for this."

usa_rockefeller_jr.2.t: "A Congress of the Corporations"
usa_rockefeller_jr.2.d: "Instead of choosing to elect a president as constitutionally neccesary, Rockefeller Jr. decided to let many powerful men from major organizations and corporations choose the next president. This move has been highly criticized by many actors, as this is a total destruction of the constitution this nation was built upon. However, this is definitely not the beginning. It is only the son of the dictator admiting that their new dynasty, is in fact, one of totalitarianism and destruction of the constitution."

The next 2 hours that followed would be living hell on earth for John, as the Businessman and Supporter of the Military Industrial Complex completely insulted his incompetence and proposed military measures to save America from the socialist threat.

But we must remind the people of the good that was achieved in the last 10 years. All the economic growth... the influence... the leverage. It was a beautiful time to be alive under Rockefeller!

USA_rockfeller_america: "Rockefeller's America"
USA_rockfeller_america_desc: "Ever since securing victory in the Election of 1912, John D. Rockefeller's Regime has transformed America into a new nation. Once thought to be a candidate of reform and progress, he has proven that he is everything but not that. The Rockefeller Administration has revamped American Society into a machine. All the democratic institutions in the country have been destroyed. The politicians in the Senate and in the House of Representatives are servants of corporations. The 1916 Revolution sealed this fate even further when it was harshly supressed by the regime and the US Armed Forces were pretty much disbanded. The violence caused by the consequences of the revolution resulted in the 1920 elections being suspended, and a literal corporate dictatorship arising to take the place of the old democracy. Now, it remains to be seen what will become of this once proud nation."
USA_industrial_nation: "No Weekends!"
USA_industrial_nation_desc: "The American Economic Machine is not powerful enough just yet. In order to boost our economic growth by a large margin, we should cut all public holidays and shorten the weekends for most employees. Of course, the work on the weekends won't be paid with more money. Instead, we will pay even less for the work hours on the weekend. The growth must continue, and the workers are the gears of the growth of our businesses and of the general American nation. What is best for the big corporations is ultimately the best for the population of the country. Once we realize this truth, we will be unstoppable."
USA_ban_communist_parties: "Ban all Socialist Parties"
USA_ban_communist_parties_desc: "Because of the failure of the Republican-Democrat Coalition to retake the country during the Revolution of 1916, new movements have formed to try and take down the regime and even liberate the American workers in general. One of these are the socialists who have been the biggest threat for the regime, especially during the Christmas riots a few days ago. It is evident that this movement must be destroyed in order to ensure security for the regime and in order to keep the money flowing. The International Workers of the World, as they call themselves, must be shot in the leg. Through a ban of all of the socialist parties that exist in America, we will be able to finally end this mischievous band. Surely, after this move, they won't come back to threaten the life of our president ever again!"

USA_polarize_the_public_desc: "There is no better way to keep a population from revolting other than turning them against each other. We will make everyone blame the other party, while we are the real perpetrators of their destruction. The Racists will blame the Communists, and the Communists will blame the Racists. The Democrats will blame the Republicans, and the Republicans will blame the Democrats. This way we will make sure that no one realizes our true plans for the American Economy. They will be blind like sheep in flocks, fighting one another. Divide and Conquer, as they say. Rockefeller knows how to make the best of every situation and how to keep the nation at bay."
USA_cut_taxes: "Cut Corporate Taxes"
USA_cut_taxes_desc: "Taxes are a myth at this point, except for the workers. They have been reduced so much for the corporations that at this point, they are irrelevant to the general government budget. And do we need a budget? Not really. Our military is in the hands of the brave corporate men who lead this nation forward. The Workers do not need health insurance nor social security, the prosperity of the nation will grant it for them instead. Now, we will make the taxes so marginal that no one will even think about the risks of commiting tax fraud. Why would they commit tax fraud over a 1% corporate tax rate? They wouldn't. Of course, to make ends meet, we will raise the taxes for the workers in order to be able to finance our economic growth even further. This is the best for them too anyways."

How dare they lie about our great nation! Anyone who dares to say that there is no freedom of speech WILL BE KILLED for what they said! No woke moralist will escape our grasp.

All will go into building new factories and roads for the betterment of our economy. This is the only thing we have to focus on. It will pay off and bring prosperity to the American workers too.

America has always placed emphasis on the 13 colonies who broke away from the British crown back in 1776, but we now know who the real original states are. When we have regained control of the rest of the states, we will have to rewire our entire country to make these 8 states the heart of our union. These states will forever have a new sense of pride as the ones who held out in our darkest hour.

USA_analyze_the_current_military_situation_desc: "Now is not the time to show weakness. Though the floor runs red with blood, the rest of America will assuredly follow if outsiders see the true state of our guns and men. We must “politely insist” that our primary military advisors and military industrialists meet up with us over a nice cup of coffee and see just what we could do just in case someone like Canada tries anything. I know the armed forces have been in rough shape since 1916, but we’re the United States, surely it can’t be that bad…right?"

Realizing this, several remaining oligarchs have requested a meeting in order to propose what they have dubbed “The Roosting Eagle Plan” or REP for short. While they have been vague about the plans' design or purpose beyond simply the name, they know for a fact we hold the money reserves from before the union collapsed.

We have much to do before we can reclaim our homes from them, but I just know they want to attack us immediately. We will set up barricades on our border with them to stop their spies from getting in here and stirring up more trouble. Let them claim they’re “fleeing” all they want, we know the truth."

The continent has been fractured, the army is in a mess, and the money we had built up is starting to run slim. Not only is it a matter of time before the breakaway states realize this, but our people as well. We can fight the breakaway states, but our own people are a different story. The moment people get wise to our situation, we face a fate worse than death, we may turn red.

Even if somehow a fair candidate won, that would cause the rich and powerful to not be so rich and powerful, and we need that money now more than ever.

USA_charles_m_schwab_will_make_them_fear_desc: "The Corporations have spoken, peace has died with Rockefeller. When people come before the courts, they will be met not with peace and understanding, but cold hard logic and steel. The world looks away thinking us weak, only to look back and see the traitors impaled on steel. GOD BLESS AMERICA, AND AMERICA ALONE."
USA_focus_on_heavy_military_industry: "Focus on Heavy Military Industry"
USA_focus_on_heavy_military_industry_desc: "What is the one thing that makes people fear? A gun to their head. What is something a nation fears? A large number of guns pointed at their heads. Attempting to focus on civilian industry will not win us wars, it will simply make people comfortable in their homes as enemy troops march in. Like it or not, being able to shoot the enemy while not being shot at takes priority. We will do this by propping up our remaining Caribbean territories so they will be able to have guns in reserve in case their neighbors try anything. Let the people moan and whine all they want, we will have enough guns in reserve to keep them quiet."
USA_expand_our_steel_mines: "Expand our Steel Mines"
USA_expand_our_steel_mines_desc: "When the union collapsed, the breakaway states took most of our resources with them, including our valuable steel. While we will of course get it back in time, our ability to produce equipment will be severely neutered while we build up. Fortunately for us, there were several steel rich states that weren’t stolen, one of which being Ohio. While the other state, Tennessee, does produce more Steel, it is also bordered by both Henry Ford and the Ku Klux Klan. Ohio on the other hand, only has borders with the much smaller socialists and Grand Lodge. It will be much safer if we put our new steel supply in the north instead of the south."

USA_an_economy_of_production_and_excavation_desc: "An economy cannot work without resources, and resources have no use without an economy to bolster. Only when every drop of oil and spec of steel is utilized to its absolute maximum potential can we say we have an economy to surpass the rest of the continent. The people will be put to work in intensive military training so that every single item in every single factory gets made in record time with consistent efficiency. Some may say putting civilians in military grade training is abuse, but any who complained likely wouldn’t have lasted long anyway. A great many people have disappeared recently, what’s a few more?"

USA_mysterious_abductions_of_the_left_desc: "After the immediate chaos of the federal collapse, a bunch of files “somehow” went missing. Interestingly, most of the “missing” names were those with leftist tendencies. Well since their names are gone, I guess they no longer exist. It really is such a shame that little Timmy “mysteriously” disappeared one day. Oh well, I guess he ran off to join the leftists out west and he will never be seen again. Oh no…Anyway-"
USA_opress_all_minorities: "Oppress ALL Minorities!"
USA_opress_all_minorities_desc: "You know, alot of time and effort has been spent on minorities feeling important. We fought a civil war for them, we spent billions fixing the south for them, and now they parade through the streets as though they are more important than us. They think we have not been very harsh with them? We have lost potential millions all in an effort to satisfy their fragile egos. They chose to complain that things were bad for them, so we will oblige them by showing them they were wrong. Should any of them have grandchildren, they will end every bedtime story with one simple message: “we didn’t even know the meaning of the word bad, not yet anyway.”"
USA_obliterate_the_urban_mafia: "Obliterate the Urban Mafia"
USA_obliterate_the_urban_mafia_desc: "As people who are both poor and make money without a corporation of some kind, criminals are probably some of the worst scum on the planet. Needless to say, oppression isn’t enough for them, they deserve nothing less than death. Our spies have been planted in their ranks from the moment Schwab took office. Once the sun goes down and the signal goes out, the public will go to sleep and chaos will reign. When the sun dawns again, the people will wake up in a crime free world. Should any try to replicate the mafia's “success,” may they look back on the Great American Gang War so they know just how much crime gets you."

When Schwab took office, our cities were little more than a plaything for liabilities weighing us down and hindering progress. Yet as more and more time passed, undesirable elements have been taken behind the metaphorical shed and very literally shot. The American people are strong, the American people are pure, but the American people are not safe. TONIGHT, WE REST. TOMORROW, WE MARCH FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA."

USA_the_question_of_the_military: "The Question of the Military"
USA_the_question_of_the_military_desc: "After the revolution of 1916, our military was rendered nearly useless. It is a miracle we did not join in the ongoing great war, we would have been little more than moral support. Nonetheless, we can’t blindly assume our own safety, that is what got Rockefeller killed in the first place. With chaos spreading even after the end of the war, having a military focussed on making money alone won’t protect us once the great powers recover and look towards the Americas in hopes of violating the Monroe Doctrine. Our air force and navy are non-existent, and the army is little more than glorified security guards for the elite. With the man who caused 1916 out of the picture, we must work to make the American military something the world can look at and think twice before attacking."
USA_re_establish_the_armed_forces: "Re-Establish the Armed Forces"
USA_re_establish_the_armed_forces_desc: "Rockefeller Sr. is dead, and Ford is no longer there to pollute our minds. As we move on from the tyranny of the past, his feudal ways of fighting have to go too. He was a fool to get rid of them in the first place, it is almost a good thing the rest of the world is collapsing, otherwise they could have attacked us as our military was a force of feudal lords commanding their troops. We must hurry and make a respectable fighting force before we are seen as an easy target by more than just Panama."
USA_form_new_army_brigades: "Form New Army Brigades"
USA_form_new_army_brigades_desc: "Now that we actually know what an army looks like, we must search our lands for those willing to fight for it. The thing about patriotism however, it can be easy to spark in the common man's mind if you just know where to look. All it would take is one man willing to fight for his home and a loud, passionate speech straight from the heart we definitely didn’t have some random desk worker make like half an hour ago."
USA_commence_a_substantial_recruitment_drive: "Commence a Substantial Recruitment Drive"
USA_commence_a_substantial_recruitment_drive_desc: "When recruitment for the armed forces was in the hands of businesses, it was surprisingly difficult to be taken on board. The heads of businesses were paranoid to the point of rejecting anyone they didn’t know, or hadn’t already been in military/mercenary service of some kind before. Our lands may be big, but this inability to get troops when it counts will definitely come back to bite us when it matters. With money not our primary concern here, we can actually form a competent army willing to recruit more than just highly experienced veterans. What kind of system would we have if every job required someone to have experience while leaving young men with no chance to get any?"
USA_reorganise_the_command_structure: "Re-organize the Command Structure"
USA_reorganise_the_command_structure_desc: "As we looked for old military records in hopes of reimplementing old formations and picking up our doctrines where they left off, we realized there were no records to be found. Whether Rockefeller was incompetent or simply destroyed them, we will never know. Regardless of the answer, we now have to start from scratch and reorganize our structure from the ground up. Fortunately for us in this case, the largest war in history ended not too long ago. If there was ever a time to rebuild structures, this would be it."
USA_assign_production_lines_for_the_military: "Assign Production Lines for the Military"
USA_assign_production_lines_for_the_military_desc: "Rockefeller practically sacrificed America all for the sake of money. Despite the horrors inflicted to get the money, it did still leave us with quite the hefty war chest. In our darkest hour, it is only right that we dip into that wealth and turn some of it into bullets and explosives. Ohio in particular has several facilities which are little more than subsistence farms for those inside of it. Using the wealth we have acquired, it will be remodeled to fit our need for war production. "
USA_prevent_another_nineteensixteen: "Prevent another 1916"
USA_prevent_another_nineteensixteen_desc: "Back in 1916, it was a miracle that we didn’t collapse into a full civil war. In order to prevent that, the military must be an ally to THE state, not THEIR state. State loyalty is what helped spark the first civil war. By ensuring loyalty to the state and the president, any potential upstarts like Roosevelt won’t be getting any funny ideas any time soon. Even if some high ranking official has the money to buy mercenaries, they won’t be fighting the same mercenaries Rockefeller employed, these will be warriors."

USA_empower_the_mercenaries: "Empower the Mercenaries"
USA_empower_the_mercenaries_desc: "While the disunified nature of our military is problematic, that does not mean it is a failure of an idea. A decentralized force has the advantage of not having a single unified weakness. Should one unit fail, that simply means you have won one battle. This modern age of warfare has called for a diversity of units and tactics. While most have taken that to mean a mix of land, sea, and air, we will take it even further than that. As each individual company modifies their tactics and equipment, it will provide all the more data the rest of our units can learn from."
USA_our_shrewd_scientists: "Our Shrewd Scientists"
USA_our_shrewd_scientists_desc: "Much like our army, a disorganized research effort also bears the gift of more data from individual experiments. When this data is combined together, we will get something far greater than our contemporaries in Europe who propose a united effort. The United States has always had individual states contributing to a greater good, this is no different. These scientists will not work on weapons alone however, they will work to improve the quality of life despite the chaos rocking our home. By attracting more people to the United States, more bright minds will work with their own methods to improve ours even further."
USA_hire_foreign_legions: "Hire Foreign Legions"
USA_hire_foreign_legions_desc: "With all of the money made by the previous administrations, we should put it towards keeping our people safe. There are soldiers all over the world willing to fight for the highest bidder, and what country has more than the United States? Why should we send young Americans to die needlessly? Between 1916 and the recent Great War, I doubt people will object to not having to fight on the frontlines. In addition, many will likely bring their families along, bringing in yet more new talent who can be used to study individual methods and experiments. "
USA_doing_right_what_ford_did_wrong: "Doing Right what Ford did Wrong"
USA_doing_right_what_ford_did_wrong_desc: "The idea of this disjointed military was not the work of Rockefeller, but his close associate, Henry Ford. But as is to be expected, he was a man of machines, not military doctrines. The blame for our poor military falls on him and him alone. Fortunately, we have the tool to correct his mistakes and actually make something out of this. While the effort is disorganized, establishing common ideas and themes among the various units will give some coordination even if they have to act together in a moments notice. Not to mention that openly throwing away Ford's military ideas will grant us more support as Henry Ford is hated by the majority of the population for the murder of Theodor Roosevelt and the suppresion of the revolution of 1916."
USA_develop_mercenary_communication_structures: "Develop Mercenary Communication Structures"
USA_develop_mercenary_communication_structures_desc: "While we shouldn't control the individual mercenary organizations, we should build the neccesary structures for them to communicate between one another and therefore effectively fight the enemy on the field. Otherwise, we will ultimately end up having severe gaps on the front leading to our eventual defeat in any war that might come our way."
USA_a_truly_corporate_military: "A Truly Corporate Military"
USA_a_truly_corporate_military_desc: "As the rest of the world relies on the sword of the state known as the military, we prefer to pack lightly. Why should we hunt rabbits with a cannon when a simple knife will do? As our enemies engage with one of our units, they will be surrounded and annihilated by another unit. These scattered are more than just tools of the rich and powerful, they represent the soul of America. We have always been a collection of small states coming together to form a titan, so too will our armed forces be small, but come together to form a force of destruction."

USA_create_a_new_airforce: "Create a New Airforce"
USA_create_a_new_airforce_desc: "Though long thought of as a mere luxury tool, or even as a neat tool for reconnaissance, the Great War has shattered expectations of what could be done when one takes to the skies. As we modernize the rest of our armed forces, we will add the airforce to the list of things we must build up. We currently lack the infrastructure to use most of the planes we plan to build, thus we will first build the runways necessary for takeoff so as to not risk damaging them by taking off from a grassy field. This should prove enough to begin basic exercises as we lay the foundation for the United States Air Force."
USA_focus_on_arial_superiority: "Focus on Arial Superiority"
USA_focus_on_arial_superiority_desc: "No matter how many bombs and guns we have, it will matter little if death rains on us from above. We must focus on securing our own skies before going on the offensive. Let the other powers focus on fancy bomber models all they want, it will matter little as our fighters act as a shield to keep them away. Resources are scarce after the Great War, so we must not get hasty and use ours wisely. "
USA_sharper_bullets: "Sharper Bullets against an Inferior Enemy"
USA_sharper_bullets_desc: "With our skies safe and secure, our enemies will have to come at us by land. When they cross our border, they will be met not just with our boys, but planes flying towards them at breakneck speed. With our previous investments keeping enemy planes out of the sky, our close air support is free to do as they please. Some may say we should use this freedom to drop bombs on our enemies, but I say we give our soldiers wings. What could be scarier than a flying man with a gun?"
USA_focus_on_tactical_bombardment: "Focus on Tactical Bombardment"
USA_focus_on_tactical_bombardment_desc: "At America's full potential, we can outproduce any nation in history. With this in mind, we must focus on our enemy’s plan and do it better than them. They will feel so confident as their bombers take to the sky, only to have that hope leave their eyes as more planes come back, all bearing the stars and stripes. The great war has shown that striking an enemy's supply line can do more damage than any gun. So I say we skip the supply lines and go straight for everything else using our superior industry to blow everything up."
USA_flood_the_skies: "Flood the Skies"
USA_flood_the_skies_desc: "Though our industry is powerful, it could always be better. Specialists have brought to our attention several deficiencies and unnecessary expenditures used in the production of bombers. With these critiques in mind, the process will be reworked and stripped of unnecessary elements. The amount we save by stripping these elements will be put to use elsewhere so our bombers will have their usefulness maximized."
USA_in_the_air_and_on_the_waters: "In the Air and on the Waters"
USA_in_the_air_and_on_the_waters_desc: "In the Air and on the Waters: Though we have been building our Air Force and Navy to act as individuals, they will only reach their full potential when they act as one unit. Building up planes specifically designed to fight against naval vessels will allow ours to fight at its maximum potential. Their planes will fall to our fighters, their convoys choked by our submarines, and their ships torn to shreds by our naval bombers. No more shall Britannia rule the waves, only the stars and stripes will own the oceans."
USA_the_naval_act: "The Naval Act"
USA_the_naval_act_desc: "In decades past, it was Britannia who ruled the waves. This was fine before the Great War where they were usually on good terms with us. But times have changed. With the old order truly gone for good, we must be prepared for the day Britain seeks revenge in hopes of turning us into a crown colony once again. There were already some concerns over a rising Japan, but now both of our oceans are unsafe for us. Only with a strong navy can we be prepared for a strike from two hostile naval powers."
USA_a_private_navy: "A Private Navy"
USA_a_private_navy_desc: "Though Rockefellers model of a corporate military got us into this mess, this sort of model does work out well when applied to a navy. Placing our shores in the hands of private companies allows for more experimentation while also acting as a type of insurance. Should one company fall or deal with incompetence, it will hurt, but our overall navy will be much stronger. A divided navy also means our enemies will have more factors to worry about as opposed to one central threat. "
USA_the_effectiveness_of_small_ships: "The Effectiveness of Small Ships"
USA_the_effectiveness_of_small_ships_desc: "Though they lost the war, the German strategy of unrestricted submarine warfare was something that had to be feared. The ability to choke out convoys can be a death sentence for a nation who doesn’t have literally everything they could ever need. By focussing on the development of submarines, the seas will be ours to control, even if we somehow fail to dominate them. Even if the British somehow manage to break our main fleet, they will not get a single moment of rest, for they will have to fear our submarines striking them down in the stone cold ocean. "
USA_a_united_fleet: "A United Fleet"
USA_a_united_fleet_desc: "Much like our army, our navy was a disorganized mess. If we are to match the British on the seas, we must reorganize and beat them at their own game. With how much damage the British received during the war, now is our chance to build up our own strength to match them. The people will definitely feel much safer knowing that our navy has been built up and our shores are safe."
USA_the_potency_of_battleships: "The Potency of Battleships"
USA_the_potency_of_battleships_desc: "During the Great War, both the Entente and Central Powers were afraid to use their heavier ships such as dreadnoughts for fear of them being destroyed. As such, they rarely saw action despite their high potential. By ironing out some of the details of their productions and redesigning them for more efficiency, we can make for of these ships so that they could actually see use on a consistent basis as opposed to being a potentially useful tool."

### Ideas ###
USA_unstable_nation: "The Scars of 1916"
USA_unstable_nation_desc: "In 1916, after Rockefeller left the Democrats, a coalition was formed between the Republicans and the Democrats in order to try to get John D. Rockefeller out of the white house. They chose Teddy Roosevelt to be their presidential candidate, and the election sure was close. However, through faking votes and a massive propaganda campaign, Rockefeller kept onto power. The nation broke down. The Republican-Democrat Coalition was outraged and people started rioting on the streets. There was bloodshed and a literal front was starting to form. It all looked like a civil war. However, in the decisive Battle of Mineapolis Teddy Roosevelt was killed by Ford's Mercenaries, and the rest of the revolution was quickly harshly supressed. This year was a hard one, and the American population still has their martyr in memory."

USA_alaskan_concentration_camps: "Alaskan Concetration Camps"
USA_alaskan_concentration_camps_desc: "We have tried to make use of every person in this country for the greater good of the businesses in America, since who doesn't love money? A move of the Rockefeller's administration that happened 2 years ago was putting nearly all the native populations of America in labor camps in Alaska. This was done in order to utilize their physical force in order to urbanize the region. However, a resistance is forming in the camps and people are getting worried. Could this policy eventually backfire?"


USA_american_corporatocracy: "American Corporatocracy"
USA_american_corporatocracy_desc: "America is a corporatocracy. The institutions are controlled by the businesses and corporations. Corruption is commonplace. The common folk doesn't have a say.

We have yet to see."

USA_uninstitutional_slavery: "Uninstitutional Slavery"

USA_socialist_nightmare: "Socialist Nightmare"
USA_socialist_nightmare_desc: "With President John. D Rockefeller's anti-worker policies, a socialist movement has formed in order to combat the new corporate state since the Republican-Democrat coalition of 1916 was clearly totally unable to do so. They are the fastest growing party in America. Unless we get the situation under control, they might try doing something... radical. THEY WILL STEAL ALL OUR MONEY, THESE BASTARDS!"

USA_corporate_military: "Corporate Military"
USA_corporate_military_desc: "Since the Revolution of 1916 in which the army betrayed our regime, The United States barely have their own military anymore.
