 ### Events ### 
 usa_collapse.1.t: "John D. Rockfeller assassinated!"
 usa_collapse.1.d: "President of the United States John. D Rockfeller, also known as the richest man in the world, was assasinated this morning while driving to a business meeting in Atlanta. His driver made a wrong turn into an abandoned street. Unfortunately for the president a disgruntled mine worker, who was also revealed to be a member of a socialist paramilitary, was sitting nearby armed with a gun. When he realized what was happening, he shot right into Rockfellers face. The driver suceeded in escaping the scene and the worker was executed. This event is rather ironic, since the Corporate President recently passed an act reducing mining workers rights. One thing is for certain though: this day will be writen about in the future as the day that changed America forever."

 ### Focuses ###
 USA_rockfeller_america: "Rockfeller's America"
 USA_rockfeller_america_desc: "Ever since securing victory in the Election of 1912, John D. Rockefeller's Regime has transformed America into a new nation. Once thought to be a candidate of reform and progress, he has proven that he is everything but not that. The Rockefeller Administration has revamped American Society into a machine. All the democratic institutions in the country have been destroyed. The politicians in the Senate and in the House of Representatives are servants of corporations. The 1916 Revolution sealed this fate even further when it was harshly supressed by the regime and the US Armed Forces were pretty much disbanded. The violence caused by the consequences of the revolution resulted in the 1920 elections being suspended, and a literal corporate dictatorship arising to take the place of the old democracy. Now, it remains to be seen what will become of this once proud nation."
 USA_industrial_nation: "No Weekends!"
 USA_industrial_nation_desc: "The American Economic Machine is not powerful enough just yet. In order to boost our economic growth by a large margin, we should cut all public holidays and shorten the weekends for most employees. Of course, the work on the weekends won't be paid with more money. Instead, we will pay even less for the work hours on the weekend. The growth must continue, and the workers are the gears of the growth of our businesses and of the general American nation. What is best for the big corporations is ultimately the best for the population of the country. Once we realize this truth, we will be unstoppable."
 USA_ban_communist_parties: "Ban all Socialist Parties"
 USA_ban_communist_parties_desc: "Because of the failure of the Republican-Democrat Coalition to retake the country during the Revolution of 1916, new movements have formed to try and take down the regime and even liberate the American workers in general. One of these are the socialists who have been the biggest threat for the regime, especially during the Christmas riots a few days ago. It is evident that this movement must be destroyed in order to ensure security for the regime and in order to keep the money flowing. The International Workers of the World, as they call themselves, must be shot in the leg. Through a ban of all of the socialist parties that exist in America, we will be able to finally end this mischievous band. Surely, after this move, they won't come back to threaten the life of our president ever again!"
 USA_polarize_the_public: "Polarize the American Public"
 USA_polarize_the_public_desc: "There is no better way to keep a population from revolting other than turning them against each other. We will make everyone blame the other party, while we are the real perpetrators of their destruction. The Racists will blame the Communists, and the Communists will blame the Racists. The Democrats will blame the Republicans, and the Republicans will blame the Democrats. This way we will make sure that no one realizes our true plans for the American Economy. They will be blind like sheep in flocks, fighting one another. Divide and Conquer, as they say. Rockefeller knows how to make the best of every situation and how to keep the nation at bay."
 USA_cut_taxes: "Cut Corporate Taxes"
 USA_cut_taxes_desc: "Taxes are a myth at this point, except for the workers. They have been reduced so much for the corporations that at this point, they are irrelevant to the general government budget. And do we need a budget? Not really. Our military is in the hands of the brave corporate men who lead this nation forward. The Workers do not need health insurance nor social security, the prosperity of the nation will grant it for them instead. Now, we will make the taxes so marginal that no one will even think about the risks of commiting tax fraud. Why would they commit tax fraud over a 1% corporate tax rate? They wouldn't. Of course, to make ends meet, we will raise the taxes for the workers in order to be able to finance our economic growth even further. This is the best for them too anyways."
 USA_up_yours: "Up Yours Woke Moralists!"
 USA_up_yours_desc: "THESE STUPID MORALISTS. They think OUR GOVERNMENT has no morals? How dare they suggest such a vile thing! Our interests are only with the men and women of this country. How dare they lie about our great nation! Anyone who dares to say that there is no freedom of speech WILL BE KILLED for what they said! No woke moralist will escape our grasp. The socialists, the journalists, all of the band! They will all be imprisoned or worse! YOU WILL PAY FOR YOUR TREACHERY! UP YOURS!"
 USA_maximize_growth: "Maximize Economic Growth"
 USA_maximize_growth_desc: "We will make sure that this nation grows, regardless of the things we have to do in order to achieve this. MAXIMIZE ALL ECONOMIC GROWTH! We will be the greatest financial empire this world has ever seen in ALL OF HISTORY! Cut all the corporate taxes, stop any social spending! All will go into building new factories and roads for the betterment of our economy. This is the only thing we have to focus on. It will pay off and bring prosperity to the American workers too. Sell off all our guns to foreign states! We don't need them no more. We will buy the entire world. There is nothing that can stop the power of money! Hail the Chief!"
 USA_american_dream_desc: "We have achieved everything we wanted! America is now the greatest nation on the planet for the Businessman! Money is flowing like never before. Every Man will be Rich in America! This is the land of dreams. The Capitalist Dream will never end from now on. Everybody will be rich and will be able to open their own business. The people are happy, the corporations are happy! There is nothing that can stop the Destiny of our nation. Manifest the Economy! Make sure everyone makes their very own business! FOR MONEY! FOR AMERICA!"

 ### Ideas ###
 USA_unstable_nation: "The Scars of 1916"
 USA_unstable_nation_desc: "In 1916, after Rockefeller left the Democrats, a coalition was formed between the Republicans and the Democrats in order to try to get John D. Rockefeller out of the white house. They chose Teddy Roosevelt to be their presidential candidate, and the election sure was close. However, through faking votes and a massive propaganda campaign, Rockefeller kept onto power. The nation broke down. The Republican-Democrat Coalition was outraged and people started rioting on the streets. There was bloodshed and a literal front was starting to form. It all looked like a civil war. However, in the decisive Battle of Mineapolis Teddy Roosevelt was killed by Ford's Mercenaries, and the rest of the revolution was quickly harshly supressed. This year was a hard one, and the American population still has their martyr in memory."
 
 USA_alaskan_concentration_camps: "Alaskan Concetration Camps"
 USA_alaskan_concentration_camps_desc: "We have tried to make use of every person in this country for the greater good of the businesses in America, since who doesn't love money? A move of the Rockefeller's administration that happened 2 years ago was putting nearly all the native populations of America in labor camps in Alaska. This was done in order to utilize their physical force in order to urbanize the region. However, a resistance is forming in the camps and people are getting worried. Could this policy eventually backfire?"
 
 
 USA_american_corporatocracy: "American Corporatocracy"
 USA_american_corporatocracy_desc: "America is a corporatocracy. The institutions are controlled by the businesses and corporations. Corruption is commonplace. The common folk doesn't have a say. This type of leadership has lead to a massive amount of economic growth never seen by humanity. Some experts call it unsustainable though. What's the truth about the American Corporate Economy? We have yet to see."
 
 USA_uninstitutional_slavery: "Uninstitutional Slavery"
 USA_uninstitutional_slavery_desc: "Even though Slavery was abolished in the American Civil War, with the new corporate America it has become commonplace that the population is completely dependant on the corporation they are working for. They are effectively slaves to the rich."
 
 USA_socialist_nightmare: "Socialist Nightmare"
 USA_socialist_nightmare_desc: "With President John. D Rockfeller's anti-worker policies, a socialist movement has formed in order to combat the new corporate state since the Republican-Democrat coalition of 1916 was clearly totally unable to do so. They are the fastest growing party in America. Unless we get the situation under control, they might try doing something... radical. THEY WILL STEAL ALL OUR MONEY, THESE BASTARDS!"
 
 USA_corporate_military: "Corporate Military"
 USA_corporate_military_desc: "Since the Revolution of 1916 in which the army betrayed our regime, The United States barely have their own military anymore. Instead, big corporations have their own private militaries which cooperate with the government. This policy allowed for greater economic growth. However, in the case of a war, our country might not be able to give a proper response."
