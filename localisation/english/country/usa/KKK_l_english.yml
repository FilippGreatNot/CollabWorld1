 ### Events ###
 kkk.1.t: "Where Did my Husband Go?"
 kkk.1.d: "Tamika came back home from work. Ever since the civil war started, her work has been marked by constant raids by klansmen and murders of her colleges. In fact, a ton of people she knew just disappeared or were confirmed to have been killed by the Klansmen. Tamika saw a letter on the table from her husband's best friend. The letter said her husband was hanged by a bunch of Klansmen. She started to cry and fell on the floor while screaming at the top of her lungs. A truly sad day for every black man and woman."
 kkk.1.a: "Well... welll... well..."
 confederacy.12.t: "The Louisiana Gathering"
 confederacy.12.d: "This night, the Klansmen are gathering in Louisiana to decide what to do with the Madman Huey Long and his rebel band. Many klansmen are screaming that Huey Long must be killed immedieately and his supporters hunted down like rabbits. However, some klansmen are more skeptic and seem to even like Huey's message."
 confederacy.12.a: "Murder Huey Long"
 confederacy.12.b: "Every Man... a King?"
 confederacy.8.t: "Ku Klux Plan"
 confederacy.8.d: "We need a manifesto that defines us and our actual ideology. Currently, we have 3 major factions within our ranks and they are all displeased with the current unclear state of hte Klan. The reformists, The moderates and the hardliners all have their own ideas for how the KKK should look like. While making this Manifesto, we have to decide which party to give the most leverage to in its writing."
 confederacy.8.a: "The Hardliners Stand Strong"
 confederacy.8.b: "Write a Manifesto of Compromise"
 confederacy.8.c: "We Need Urgent Reforms"
 confederacy.11.t: "The Mississippi March"
 confederacy.11.d: "Black Rebels and Activists have been sabotaging our industries and murdering our families. Well maybe the last part is not true... but we will make our Klansmen believe it is! Because there is no better thing than throwing our own faults at these Blacks! So... Grand Wizzard Man, what should we do to these rebels?"
 confederacy.11.a: "Remind the men they jerked off in front of a crowd"
 confederacy.11.b: "Let them be Personal Servants for our Klansmen!"
 confederacy.3.t: "Reformists within the Klan"
 confederacy.3.d: "The Reformist Fraction in the Klan has criticized our recent actions. They argue our recklessness in dealing with the Question of the Colored has been too large. According to their argument, if we are too quick and too reckless in our actions the clan will collapse due to inside pressure and stability within the country. After all, we are not just an organization anymore but we are leading a country. Therefore it is important that we care about these questions. But after all, does it REALLY matter? Is being careful that important for true brave men like us?"
 confederacy.3.a: "Regret... Hate..."
 confederacy.4.t: "Klansmen Jerk Off In Front of Large Crowd"
 confederacy.4.d: "The reformists are once again criticizing our recklessness. Recently in Alabama, about five klansmen gathered a bunch of people of all colors in the town square, stepped onto a stage, and started jerking off right in front of them. These actions have led to the entire Klan suffering a stability hit, and our enemies are laughing at us and calling us degenerates. Should we listen to the reformists and punish these men by death?"
 confederacy.4.a: "Come on guys... they were just horny!"
 confederacy.4.b: "No Degenerates within Our Ranks!"
 confederacy.2.t: "The Question of Slavery"
 confederacy.2.d: "With the South having arisen from the ashes, we need to decide whether we want to embrace slavery as a form of economics in order to boost our economy. Many more radical Ku Klux Klan members are proposing more radical solutions which many would call straightup criminal. They argue we should start smashing heads. Surely, they are lunatics and murderers, but maybe there is something to the idea of a fully homogenic America?"
 confederacy.2.a: "Get baaaaack to woooork!"
 confederacy.2.b: "Where did my husband disappear?"
 confederacy.3.a: "Restore Slavery"
 confederacy.3.b: "The Other Option..."
 confederacy.1.t: "Old Armories Looted"
 confederacy.1.d: "Our loyal Klansmen have succesfully raided multiple armories of old collapsed corporations from the Rockefeller Era. With these new guns in our hands, we will be able to terrorize all those who seek to oppose the Rightous Ku Klux Klan! The colored- the reds- the capitalists- they are all the enemies of the Ku Klux Klan! And with these weapons, we will be able to destroy them once and for all!"
 confederacy.1.a: "The South Rises Again"
 confederacy.13.t: "The Question of the Police"
 confederacy.13.d: "We need to decide on a police of how to establish law and order in our states. Currently, there is a lack of crime fighting departments which would lower crime and help ensure the safety of citizens. The reformists argue we should establish an independent police which serves separately from the KKK. However, the Hardliners are not pleased. They propose making the Klansmen be the actual police force. An interesting proposal to say the least."
 confederacy.13.a: "Klansmen are the Law"
 confederacy.13.b: "Establish an Independent Police"
