Some more moderate dixiecrates argue that we stepped over the line with our cooperation with National Syndicalists and that if we don't get our violence under control, the Ku Klux Klan will fall. These are clearly spies from the Black Brotherhood of Criminals in New Orleans. Ship them all off to Cuba."
