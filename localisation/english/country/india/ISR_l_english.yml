  ISR_a_dream_reborn: "A Dream Reborn"
  ISR_a_dream_reborn_desc: "The dream of a Jewish homeland is now a reality, but the struggle for survival is only beginning. After centuries of oppression, and persecution and expulsion the jewish people have never had a safe long term home to stay in and to thrive in, however a opportunity has began to appear as a new jewish controlled state appears off the coast of the Indian ocean. Now is the time to move in and consolidate the beach head"

  ISR_legacy_of_the_raj: "Legacy of the Raj"
  ISR_legacy_of_the_raj_desc: "After the catastrophe of the Great War, the British Isles were left in ruin, their male working population bled dry from the bloodbaths that plagued the western front, and with the economic hardships and political disasters that followed, it resulted in a hardliner military coup which saw all forms of the old British Government abolished and a hardliner military dictatorship to pick up the fragments of whatever remained of the "United Kingdom". Following the troubling events many countries and former dominions seceded the commonwealth into their own independent, however unfortunetly for the vastly diverse Indian nation as after almost a century of exploitation, brutal oppression and famine the Indian nation did not come unscaved and what followed was the complete collapse of the new Indian administration and subsequent collapse of the new Indian republic as tribes and militias began claiming vast amounts of land for their own. The fate of India seems bleek and only through more blood and hardship can perhaps India one day emerge harmonious and free from bloodbaths and trouble. "
