 kalat.1.t: "The Afghan-Brahui War"
 kalat.1.d: "Beginning today, the Afghan state has mobilised and uttered a force of roughly 170,000 men, to take up arms and cross the border that had recently formed between their nation and that of the Brahui Monarchy, Kalat, in the remains of the former Baluchistan agency, to finally conquer their last claims on that land, and subjugate the monarch to finally maintain a presence on the indian coast. A sight to behold is that in Quetta, where anti-governmental forces have taken up arms and are willing to secede whenever is possible."
