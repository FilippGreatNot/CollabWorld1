 LAT_bermontian_clique_rule: "Bermontian Clique Rule"
 LAT_bermontion_clique_rule_desc: "The Bermontian Clique, led by Pavel Bermondt-Avalov, has brought a firm, militaristic vision to the Western Russian Volunteer Army. Though their rule is not without challenges, they have managed to unite various factions under a banner of strong leadership and national revival. The Bermontian Clique excels at rallying the populace and military around a shared cause, increasing recruitment and bolstering the army’s combat strength on home soil. Their authoritarian style of governance enables swift decision-making, especially in military matters, even if it occasionally stifles political stability and economic efficiency."

 LAT_disorganized_army: "Disorganized Army"
 LAT_disorganized_army_descp: "The Western Russian Volunteer Army is plagued by internal disunity, lack of proper hierarchy, and competing factions vying for influence. Commanders often act independently, with little to no coordination between units. Supply lines are unreliable, and soldiers lack discipline, leading to inefficient combat operations. The army is a patchwork of poorly trained conscripts, volunteers, and rogue officers, resulting in slow decision-making and low morale on the battlefield."
 LAT_the_forest_brothers: "The Forest Brothers"
 LAT_the_forest_brothers_descp: " The Western Russian Volunteer Army faces a persistent challenge from the Forest Brothers, a network of partisan fighters entrenched in the dense forests and remote areas. These guerrilla forces, largely composed of anti-authoritarian and nationalist elements, sabotage supply lines, ambush military convoys, and disrupt communications across occupied territories. The Forest Brothers' deep knowledge of the terrain makes it difficult to suppress their activities, forcing the Volunteer Army to devote significant resources to counterinsurgency operations. The constant threat of ambushes and resistance wears down the army, straining logistics and reducing overall effectiveness in maintaining control"

 LAT_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The West Volunteer Army, led by Pavel Bertmont-Avalov, finds itself in a dangerous position. It lays sorrounded by two bolshevik powers, the Muscovite Soviet Government and the Regime of the Red Napoleon. Both actively undermine the West Volunteer Army's Security and seek to destroy it. In order to be able to unite Russia under his rule or achieve his dreams of Baltic German supremacy, Pavel will have to make sacrifices."

 lat.2.t: "The Question of Doctrine"
 lat.2.d: "The Rüdiger Clique is proposing making our army based on the doctine of superior firepower and focusing on the abilities of our artillery.

This question is very important and might decide the fate of the battlefield."
