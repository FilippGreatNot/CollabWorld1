 WVA_bermontian_clique_rule: "Bermontian Clique Rule"
 WVA_bermontion_clique_rule_desc: "The Bermontian Clique, led by Pavel Bermondt-Avalov, has brought a firm, militaristic vision to the Western Russian Volunteer Army. Though their rule is not without challenges, they have managed to unite various factions under a banner of strong leadership and national revival. The Bermontian Clique excels at rallying the populace and military around a shared cause, increasing recruitment and bolstering the army’s combat strength on home soil. Their authoritarian style of governance enables swift decision-making, especially in military matters, even if it occasionally stifles political stability and economic efficiency."
 WVA_native_unrest: "Native Unrest"
 WVA_disorganized_army: "Disorganized Army"
 WVA_disorganized_army_descp: "The Western Russian Volunteer Army is plagued by internal disunity, lack of proper hierarchy, and competing factions vying for influence. Commanders often act independently, with little to no coordination between units. Supply lines are unreliable, and soldiers lack discipline, leading to inefficient combat operations. The army is a patchwork of poorly trained conscripts, volunteers, and rogue officers, resulting in slow decision-making and low morale on the battlefield."
 WVA_the_forest_brothers: "The Forest Brothers"
 WVA_the_forest_brothers_descp: "The Western Russian Volunteer Army faces a persistent challenge from the Forest Brothers, a network of partisan fighters entrenched in the dense forests and remote areas. These guerrilla forces, largely composed of anti-authoritarian and nationalist elements, sabotage supply lines, ambush military convoys, and disrupt communications across occupied territories. The Forest Brothers' deep knowledge of the terrain makes it difficult to suppress their activities, forcing the Volunteer Army to devote significant resources to counterinsurgency operations. The constant threat of ambushes and resistance wears down the army, straining logistics and reducing overall effectiveness in maintaining control"

 WVA_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The West Volunteer Army, led by Pavel Bertmont-Avalov, finds itself in a dangerous position. It lays sorrounded by two bolshevik powers, the Muscovite Soviet Government and the Regime of the Red Napoleon. Both actively undermine the West Volunteer Army's Security and seek to destroy it. In order to be able to unite Russia under his rule or achieve his dreams of Baltic German supremacy, Pavel will have to make sacrifices."
 
 wva.1.t: "The Forest Brothers"
 wva.1.d: "Our rule on the Baltic region has been met with stiff resistance from many people. They have formed a unified guerilla resistance movement in order to kick us out of the region. In order to ensure the continuation of our regime here, we must defeat these degenerate bolshevik spies before they ruin us"
 wva.1.a: "CLEAR THEM OUT!"
 wva.2.t: "The Question of Doctrine"
 wva.2.d: "The Rüdiger Clique is proposing making our army based on the doctine of superior firepower and focusing on the abilities of our artillery. This doctrine is clearly in conflict with the one proposed by the Bermontians, who propose a doctrine of mass assault and mass conscription of both natives and baltic germans alike. This question is very important and might decide the fate of the battlefield."
 wva.2.a: "Keep Pavel's Doctine"
 wva.2.b: "Rüdiger's Doctrine has More Merit"
 wva.3.t: "Offer from Pavel"
 wva.3.d: "The General Pavel Bermondt Avalov has offered us integration into the Western Cossack Government. We will be able to keep a position within his new formed Russian State. He also proposes that we should help him take out the Soviets. Our interests align almost perfectly. Perhaps, to save Russia from the Bolshevik plague, we might need to join forces."

 WVA_pavels_reforms_desc: "Pavel Bermondt-Avalov is a feared man across the territories of the Russian Empire and his West Volunteer Army even more so. We have succesfuly held out against the degenerate bolsheviks and their fragile soviet republic. Now that our security has been ensured, we must continue with Pavel's plan. The Forest Brothers, a baltic-wide resistance organization, keeps trying to mess with our rule and establish independent Baltic states. We will now allow this to happen. These rebels must be destroyed, and we will make sure of that by all means neccesary."
 WVA_further_opression_of_the_baltic_people_desc: "We need to opress those individuals who have clearly aligned themselves with the Forest Brothers.

Our army will always be presented in the said settlements, which we will use as bases to launch operations against the Forest Brothers."

 WVA_the_forest_brothers_problem_desc: "The situation on the Baltic countryside is getting out of hand. While we originally thought that the issue of the Forest Brothers would disappear rather quickly, our plans have failed to show any real results.

 WVA_killing_of_suspected_forest_brothers_members_desc: "We can't take risks.

 WVA_the_mistake_of_the_other_whites_desc: "The other parts of the white army, while perhaps even controlling more land currently than ourselves, are inevitably doomed. This is because of 2 key reasons. Firstly, they are extremely arrogant and don't like to adapt to new situations like we are forced to. The second reason is that they are extremely corrupt and don't even truly believe in the cause they are serving. I bet you Kolchak would even have joined the Red Army if it brought him personal gain. We will not end up like this. We serve God! Our purpose is clear and we will achieve our goals."
