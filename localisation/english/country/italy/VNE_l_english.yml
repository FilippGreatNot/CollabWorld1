 ### Events ###
 Venice.1.t: "The Rebirth Of Venice"
 Venice.1.d: "In the wake of the political turmoil and unrest that engulfed Italy in the 1920s, the once-unified nation has splintered into a chaotic mosaic of warlord states. Amidst the ashes of the former Italian kingdom, the city of Venice has risen anew, declaring its independence and sovereignty. As the rest of Italy plunged into warlordism and internal strife, the Venetians, with their rich history of maritime prowess and republicanism, seized the opportunity to break free from the chaos. The newly established Venetian state is now poised to navigate the turbulent waters of this fractured land, determined to restore its former glory and protect its people from the surrounding anarchy. With stability gradually returning and political power concentrated under visionary leadership, Venice stands as a beacon of hope and resilience. The challenges ahead are formidable, but the spirit of Venice is unyielding, ready to face the trials of a new era."
 Venice.1.a: "Hooray!"
