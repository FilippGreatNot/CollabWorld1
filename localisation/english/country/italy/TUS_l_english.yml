 tus.1.t: "The Empire Will Rise Again!"
 tus.1.d: "The Tuscan legion is a ruthless regime formed by the remnants of the Italian army that resided in Tuscany. They serve under Italo Balbo, who seeks to bring back the glory days of the Italian empire and spread its influence across Europe. The only thing holding the legion together is its loyalty to its leader, for without clear direction and a firm hand, it would crumble under its own weight."

 tus.10.t: "Army Reform"
 tus.10.d: "The Tuscan Army consists of scraps of the old brigades of Tuscany and needs reforms to be brought up to modern standards. This is not to say that the army of Tuscany is not a foe to be reckoned with, but due to a crumbling chain of command and no clear focus, it has fallen into disrepair. We must choose a focus and strong leaders if we hope to one day match or outmatch the great Italian army."
