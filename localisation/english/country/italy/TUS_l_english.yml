 TUS_BOOKMARK_DESC: "After the king fled from Rome to Sardinia, Tuscany was the last mainland holdout point for the previous Italian Empire. After the garrisons there were all but abandoned, Black Shirt leader and air and navy general Italo Balbo seized control. With the help of the Black Shirts, the remaining garrisons were able to secure all of Tuscany before hitting a stalemate. By then Italo Balbo had already formed his Grand Council, consisting of remaining top-ranking government and Black Shirt officials, who are hellbent on one day bringing back the almighty Italian Empire."

 tus.1.d: "The Tuscan legion is a ruthless regime formed by the remnants of the Italian army that resided in Tuscany. They serve under Italo Balbo, who seeks to bring back the glory days of the Italian empire and spread its influence across Europe. The only thing holding the legion together is its loyalty to its leader, for without clear direction and a firm hand, it would crumble under its own weight."

 tus.3.t: "Balbo's Speech"
 tus.3.d: ""People of Italy, today we stand at the dawn of a new era, ready to cast off the chaos and division that have plagued our great nation for far too long. In the south, the cowards of the republic have done nothing but sow weakness and corruption, betraying our people with their empty promises. Meanwhile, in the north, the socialists have flaunted their utopian ideals, but in this world, such fantasies will never endure. They cling to their vision of a so-called workers’ state, yet their hollow rhetoric and lack of resolve reveal them as unfit to shape the future of Italy. Their dream is destined to crumble, for only true strength and unity can forge a lasting nation. We will not bow to weakness—we will build a new Italy, proud and unbreakable!"-Italo Balbo"
