 vat.1.t: "Death of the Pope!"
 vat.1.d: "Pope Benedict XV died at six o'clock on the 22rd. The Cardinals and members of the Papal Court were summoned at 5:30 and were present until the Pope breathed his last. His heart continued to beat until six o'clock when Dr. Cherubini said gravely: "The Pope has passed away." Cardinal Merry del Val carried out the time-honored ceremony of calling the Pope three times by his Christian name, Giacomo della Chiesa. When after the third call no answer was received, the cardinal turned to the members of the Papal Court, who were deeply moved, and announced: "The Pope is really dead.""
