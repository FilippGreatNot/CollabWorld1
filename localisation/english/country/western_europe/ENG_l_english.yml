 ENG_fullers_britain_desc: "At last, a short time ago, the Great War Hero and wise military general J.F.C Fuller has seized control over the isles. However, this didn't go as planned. The royal family didn't submit to Fuller's rule so they had to go into exile to Canada, or at least that's what they plan to do. Meanwhile, a resistance movement has formed to combat Fuller's regime called His Majesty's Royal Resistance. They do terror attacks all across the country, severely damaging our control. On top of that, we are seeing massive resistance in our colonies and most of our dominions across the world have declared independence. The time has come to seize Britannia's glory back, stronger and more proud than ever."

 ENG_purge_military: "Purge the Military"

No running, rebels and disorderly people! Make me some fish and chips sir would you? "
 
 ENG_radicals: "Utilize the Radicals"
 ENG_radicals_desc: "There are many radicals within our realm who can be used in order to combat the HMRR, a terrorist against a terrorist so to say.

 ENG_arrest_dissidents: "Arrest Dissidents"
 ENG_arrest_dissidents_desc: "We must arrest all known dissidents of the HMRR. Do not let anyone escape, all straight to prison.

For a Better Britain."

RECLAIM THE BIRTHRIGHT!"
 
 ENG_department_of_truth_desc: "We must establish a special institution which can share the eternal truth to the British People.
