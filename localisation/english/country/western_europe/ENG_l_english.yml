 ### Ideas ###
 ENG_his_majestys_royal_resistance: "The King's Constitutional Resistance"
 ENG_his_majestys_royal_resistance_desc: "The takeover of the Fuller Regime was not without any resistance. The British Royal Family and various British politicians and generals left for Canada. Using their connections inside the country, they've formed an armed resistance against the Fuller Regime. These rebels keep attacking our army outposts and assasinating our officers with the goal of restoring democracy in Britain. In order to ensure the stability of our regime, these rebels must be taken out by military force. Otherwise, they will keep being a thorn in our side and could use any difficult situation to launch an uprising."
 ENG_economic_turmoil: "Economic Turmoil"
 ENG_economic_turmoil_desc: "The Great War was a disaster for the British Economy. We've been left impoverished with unemployment being rampant and debts to the Rockefeller Administration that can inevitably never truly be repaid. The wealth gap is larger than ever, with the elites exploiting the poor working man as much as they can. While sometimes profitable, the situation on that front is making many workers very angry. With Fuller's Coup, we've also lost many valuable assets with a ton of wealth being moved quickly to Canada. We will need to take drastic measures in order to save our economy or the people of the Isles will continue to suffer and starve."
 ENG_colonial_unrest: "Colonial Unrest"
 ENG_colonial_unrest_desc: "The situation on the island has caused many colonies to declare independence and leave the empire. Yet those which remain under our control are also rebellious. Organizations have formed which seek to abandon the empire either by negotiations or by force. With the current situation, their chosen method is mostly violence. These rebels are a major threat for the continuation of the British Empire, or at least what is left of it. We need to find a solution as soon as possible, unless we want to risk the sun finally settng upon the British Empire."
 
 IRE_ira: "Irish Republican Army"
