 ### Ideas ###
 ENG_his_majestys_royal_resistance: "The King's Constitutional Resistance"
 ENG_his_majestys_royal_resistance_desc: "The takeover of the Fuller Regime was not without any resistance. The British Royal Family and various British politicians and generals left for Canada. Using their connections inside the country, they've formed an armed resistance against the Fuller Regime. These rebels keep attacking our army outposts and assasinating our officers with the goal of restoring democracy in Britain. In order to ensure the stability of our regime, these rebels must be taken out by military force. Otherwise, they will keep being a thorn in our side and could use any difficult situation to launch an uprising."
 ENG_economic_turmoil: "Economic Turmoil"
 ENG_economic_turmoil_desc: "The Great War was a disaster for the British Economy. We've been left impoverished with unemployment being rampant and debts to the Rockefeller Administration that can inevitably never truly be repaid. The wealth gap is larger than ever, with the elites exploiting the poor working man as much as they can. While sometimes profitable, the situation on that front is making many workers very angry. With Fuller's Coup, we've also lost many valuable assets with a ton of wealth being moved quickly to Canada. We will need to take drastic measures in order to save our economy or the people of the Isles will continue to suffer and starve."
 ENG_colonial_unrest: "Colonial Unrest"
 ENG_colonial_unrest_desc: "The situation on the island has caused many colonies to declare independence and leave the empire. Yet those which remain under our control are also rebellious. Organizations have formed which seek to abandon the empire either by negotiations or by force. With the current situation, their chosen method is mostly violence. These rebels are a major threat for the continuation of the British Empire, or at least what is left of it. We need to find a solution as soon as possible, unless we want to risk the sun finally settng upon the British Empire."
 
 IRE_ira: "Irish Republican Army"

 ENG_crack_down_on_the_socialist_rioteers: "Crack Down on the Socialist Rioteers"
 ENG_crack_down_on_the_socialist_rioteers_desc: "The growing unrest among socialist agitators poses a direct threat to the stability and order that the military regime has worked tirelessly to establish. Emboldened by radical rhetoric and support from Moscow, these rioters seek to dismantle the very foundations of Britain’s security, spreading chaos in the streets and challenging the authority of the state. Their violent demonstrations, strikes, and calls for revolution cannot be tolerated any longer. The army and security forces will be deployed to restore order, using all necessary measures to disperse protests and dismantle subversive networks. Leaders of these movements will be swiftly arrested and tried for sedition, ensuring that no figurehead remains to inspire further resistance. Martial law will be enforced in areas of persistent unrest, with curfews and military patrols keeping socialist elements in check. Any organizations or publications that spread socialist ideology will be censored or dismantled to prevent further radicalization. The British people must understand that only through strength and discipline can the nation be preserved from the anarchy these revolutionaries seek to impose. By crushing this movement now, the regime ensures that Britain remains firm, orderly, and unwavering in its march toward a stronger future."

 ENG_maintain_a_military_orientated_regime: "Maintain a Military Regime"
 ENG_maintain_a_military_orientated_regime_desc: "The armed forces have secured Britain’s stability, and there is no reason to relinquish control to civilian politicians who would only sow division and weaken our hard-earned order. Nationalist politicians, eager to seize power, call for a return to traditional governance, but their rhetoric threatens to undo the disciplined and structured state we have built. Instead, the military must remain the backbone of the nation, ensuring that all key institutions—from the government to the economy—operate under its firm and rational guidance. Civilian interference, driven by populism and emotion, would only erode the efficiency and unity that military leadership has imposed upon Britain. \n \n To solidify our rule, military officials will be placed in key administrative positions, ensuring that the army’s vision remains paramount in policy-making. Dissent within the ranks of government will be swiftly addressed, with subversive elements removed before they can undermine the regime’s authority. Political parties, if they are to exist at all, must serve as mere advisory bodies, with no power to challenge military governance. The public must be reminded that it was the army, not self-serving politicians, that saved Britain from chaos, and it will continue to do so. By securing our control over all aspects of the state, we ensure that Britain remains powerful, efficient, and unburdened by the failings of civilian rule."
 ENG_calm_down_the_english_church: "Calm Down the English Church"
 ENG_calm_down_the_english_church_desc: "In response to the growing tensions between Fuller's regime and the English Church, it has become clear that stabilizing the relationship with the clergy is essential for maintaining social cohesion and avoiding further unrest. The Church, deeply entrenched in British society, sees the increasing influence of Aleister Crowley and the regime's authoritarian shift as a direct challenge to its authority and influence over the nation. A decisive move must be made to assure the Church that it remains a pillar of moral guidance in the nation and that its role is secure under Fuller's leadership. \n \n By offering concessions, such as a guarantee of religious freedoms and ensuring that the Church retains control over its own affairs, Fuller can defuse the mounting criticism. The regime must also publicly reaffirm its commitment to the Christian values that have historically underpinned British society, distancing itself from any perceived occult or heretical movements. This focus would involve diplomatic outreach to Church leaders, including high-profile meetings with the Archbishop of Canterbury and other influential clerics, to ensure their concerns are addressed and their support is won. While Fuller's military rule will remain intact, it will be important to project an image of unity between the Church and state, reassuring the populace that religious institutions will not be undermined."
 ENG_appease_crowleys_occultists: "Appease Crowley's Occultists"
 ENG_appease_crowleys_occultists_desc: "As part of Fuller's leadership coalition, Aleister Crowley holds significant influence, particularly within the occult and intellectual circles. His views, often controversial, are gaining traction, and his philosophical influence could prove invaluable to the stability of Fuller's regime. However, appeasing Crowley requires a delicate balance, as his radical ideas challenge traditional societal norms and, most notably, the English Church. The clergy, already wary of Fuller's militaristic approach, now sees Crowley’s growing power as a direct threat to their religious authority. Despite this, Fuller's regime recognizes the strategic advantage of aligning with Crowley’s network of followers, especially in consolidating power and ensuring unity within the military and political elite. By offering Crowley greater recognition and freedom, Fuller hopes to placate his more vocal supporters and gain crucial influence in occult and intellectual circles that could aid in the regime's long-term goals. Crowley’s presence as a symbol of defiance against traditional structures could serve as both a unifying and destabilizing force, which Fuller intends to harness. \n \n  The appeasement could create a unique cultural shift, blending occultism with the state’s military power in a way that resonates with a broader population."
