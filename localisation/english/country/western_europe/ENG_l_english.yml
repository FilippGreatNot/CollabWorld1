 ### Ideas ###
 ENG_his_majestys_royal_resistance: "The King's Constitutional Resistance"
 ENG_his_majestys_royal_resistance_desc: "The takeover of the Fuller Regime was not without any resistance. The British Royal Family and various British politicians and generals left for Canada. Using their connections inside the country, they've formed an armed resistance against the Fuller Regime. These rebels keep attacking our army outposts and assasinating our officers with the goal of restoring democracy in Britain. In order to ensure the stability of our regime, these rebels must be taken out by military force. Otherwise, they will keep being a thorn in our side and could use any difficult situation to launch an uprising."
 ENG_economic_turmoil: "Economic Turmoil"
 ENG_economic_turmoil_desc: "The Great War was a disaster for the British Economy. We've been left impoverished with unemployment being rampant and debts to the Rockefeller Administration that can inevitably never truly be repaid. The wealth gap is larger than ever, with the elites exploiting the poor working man as much as they can. While sometimes profitable, the situation on that front is making many workers very angry. With Fuller's Coup, we've also lost many valuable assets with a ton of wealth being moved quickly to Canada. We will need to take drastic measures in order to save our economy or the people of the Isles will continue to suffer and starve."
 ENG_colonial_unrest: "Colonial Unrest"
 ENG_colonial_unrest_desc: "The situation on the island has caused many colonies to declare independence and leave the empire. Yet those which remain under our control are also rebellious. Organizations have formed which seek to abandon the empire either by negotiations or by force. With the current situation, their chosen method is mostly violence. These rebels are a major threat for the continuation of the British Empire, or at least what is left of it. We need to find a solution as soon as possible, unless we want to risk the sun finally settng upon the British Empire."

 ### Events ###
 eng.1.t: "Internal Report: The Crowley Coup"
 eng.1.d: "The government has collapsed into chaos. J.F.C. Fuller has been overthrown in a swift and brutal coup orchestrated by Aleister Crowley, who has now declared himself the supreme ruler of Britain. Fuller's incompetence and failure to manage his own inner circle allowed Crowley to gain influence, quietly eliminating rivals and securing key positions of power. When the time was right, he struck without hesitation—loyalist officers were executed, and entire branches of the military command structure were dismantled overnight. Reports indicate mass purges across the government, with thousands imprisoned or outright executed for suspected disloyalty. The streets of London and other major cities are in turmoil, as anti-Crowley protests escalate into violent clashes with government forces. The English Church has publicly denounced Crowley’s rule as heretical, with clergy members calling for open resistance. Meanwhile, remnants of Fuller’s military loyalists have gone into hiding, possibly regrouping for a counteroffensive. The armed forces are now fractured, with some battalions refusing orders and others outright defecting. Intelligence suggests that Crowley’s supporters are moving quickly to consolidate power, using extreme measures to suppress dissent. Public morale is deteriorating, and fears of an all-out civil conflict are growing by the day. Foreign governments have taken notice, though their response remains uncertain. If immediate action is not taken, Britain may be plunged into irreversible chaos. Decisions must be made now—either to stabilize Crowley’s rule or to rally what remains of the old order before it is too late."
 eng.1.a: "The Nightmare begins..."
 eng.2.t: "The Beast Seizes the Throne"
 eng.2.d: "J.F.C. Fuller’s rule has ended in bloodshed as Aleister Crowley, once his ally, has overthrown him in a swift and brutal coup. Fuller's mismanagement and failure to maintain control allowed Crowley to amass power, and when the time was right, he struck without mercy. The general was swiftly removedn, while Crowley’s supporters launched widespread purges, executing or imprisoning thousands of military officers. Protests and riots have erupted across the country, with furious crowds denouncing the regime’s brutality and Crowley’s rise to power. The Church has declared his rule blasphemous, and are calling to resistance. Britain’s army is fractured, with some officers fleeing the country. Now, Crowley sits atop the remnants of Fuller's regime, but whether he can hold onto power—or if his rule will only plunge Britain into chaos."
 eng.2.a: "Midnight Descends Upon Britain"
 eng.3.t: "The General and the Magus"
 eng.3.d: "J.F.C. Fuller sat across from Aleister Crowley in a dimly lit chamber, the air thick with incense and an unsettling sense of expectation. The general, ever the strategist, had invited Crowley to discuss the deeper philosophies that might guide Britain’s future, but the conversation had quickly taken an unusual turn. Crowley, draped in his ritual robes, spoke of hidden energies, ancient rites, and the power that lay beyond the material world. Fuller, a man of military precision, found himself both intrigued and wary, his mind caught between pragmatic governance and the strange allure of the occult. “Discipline is the foundation of all power,” Fuller asserted, tapping his fingers on the table. Crowley smiled, his eyes gleaming in the candlelight. “Discipline is merely the gateway, my dear general. True power lies in understanding the forces that shape reality itself.” He gestured toward the intricate symbols carved into the walls, speaking of cosmic alignments and the will to transcend earthly limitations. Fuller remained silent for a moment, considering whether such knowledge could be harnessed for the state or if it was merely dangerous mysticism. “Britain must be strong, not lost in dreams,” he finally replied. Crowley leaned forward, his voice a whisper. “Strength without enlightenment is nothing but shackles on the soul.” The tension in the room was palpable—two men, both believers in power, yet divided by their visions of how it should be wielded. Finally, Fuller leaned back in his chair, his expression unreadable. “It seems your talents may yet serve the nation in ways we’ve only begun to explore,” he said carefully. Crowley’s smile widened, his fingers tapping against the table in quiet satisfaction—he had been heard, and soon, his influence would grow."
 eng.3.a: "A peculiar friendship..."
 eng.4.t: "A Meeting of Cross and Sword"
 eng.4.d: "J.F.C. Fuller sat across from the Archbishop of Canterbury in a private chamber, the air thick with tension. The Church had grown increasingly alarmed by the presence of Aleister Crowley within the regime, fearing his influence would lead Britain down a path of heresy and corruption. The Archbishop, his voice steady but firm, expressed the clergy’s deep concerns, warning that Crowley’s involvement could turn the people against the government. Fuller, ever the pragmatist, leaned forward with a reassuring smile. “I understand your concerns, Your Grace, but I assure you—Crowley is not nearly as powerful as he pretends to be.” He explained that Crowley’s role was exaggerated, that his esoteric ideas were tolerated more for their usefulness than as a guiding philosophy of the state. “Britain is still ruled by men of order, not mystics,” Fuller continued, choosing his words carefully. “The Church has nothing to fear—we are building a strong nation, not an occult empire.” The Archbishop studied him for a long moment before nodding, though traces of doubt lingered in his expression. While the meeting eased tensions, it was clear the Church would continue to watch Crowley closely. As the Archbishop departed, Fuller exhaled, knowing that keeping both Crowley and the clergy in line would be a delicate balancing act. For now, the flames of religious unrest had been dampened—but for how long?"
 eng.4.a: "They will trust us one day."
 eng.5.t: "A Not so Kindly-Worded Letter"
 eng.5.d: "J.F.C. Fuller unfolded the letter carefully, already knowing who had sent it. Rotha Lintorn-Orman, ever the defiant nationalist, had long voiced her frustrations with military rule, but now her words carried a sharper edge. The ink was bold and unyielding, the strokes of her pen pressing deep into the paper as if her fury alone could break through the iron grip of the military state. “You claim to serve the nation, yet you cling to the bayonets and barracks as if Britain were nothing more than a battlefield,” she wrote. She accused Fuller of turning Britain into a barracks-state, refusing to return power to those who could lead the nation with true vision and purpose. The people, she argued, had suffered enough under endless military decrees and rule by the gun—now was the time for Britain to have a government led by patriots, not generals. “Or is it that you fear true leadership? That you know, given the choice, Britain would turn away from the officers who refuse to step down?” she challenged. Fuller read the letter twice, his expression unreadable. Lintorn-Orman was not a woman easily dismissed—her followers were growing in number, and her words resonated with many who saw military rule as an obstacle rather than a safeguard. Yet, Fuller had no intention of surrendering control, not when the nation was still so fragile. The army had saved Britain from chaos, and only the army could ensure it did not fall back into ruin. Still, he knew better than to ignore such a challenge outright. Would Lintorn-Orman become a mere nuisance, barking from the sidelines, or could her movement evolve into something far more dangerous? Folding the letter carefully, he set it aside, already considering how best to respond. Britain’s future was not yet secure—and neither was his own."
 eng.5.a: "A Disloyal Ally?"
 eng.6.t: "Internal Report: Lintorn-Orman's Revolt"
 eng.6.d: ""
 eng.6.a: "SLAAAY QUEEEN!!!!!"
 eng.7.t: "The March on London"
 eng.7.d: "The Nationalist Movement in Britain, which had originally helped John F.C Fuller rise to power, has been very annoyed with the power of the military within Britain. When Fuller couped the British government back in 1921, they imagined that Fuller would respect the control of governors, politicians and local officials. Instead, he promoted the military's interests above all else. Now, the glass has been spilled. The Nationalist Officials, led by Rotha Lintorn-Orman, called the people to rise against the Fuller regime and march on London. The military, scared of a civil war, didn't shoot at the marching civilians. At the evening, London was captured by the masses and Rotha Lintorn-Orman assumed control of the country. The military is raging with a half of their power having been taken away, but they've kept their mouths shut for now."
 eng.7.a: "A Civilian Junta?"

 ENG_crack_down_on_the_socialist_rioteers_desc: "The growing unrest among socialist agitators poses a direct threat to the stability and order that the military regime has worked tirelessly to establish. Emboldened by radical rhetoric and support from Moscow, these rioters seek to dismantle the very foundations of Britain’s security, spreading chaos in the streets and challenging the authority of the state. Their violent demonstrations, strikes, and calls for revolution cannot be tolerated any longer. The army and security forces will be deployed to restore order, using all necessary measures to disperse protests and dismantle subversive networks. Leaders of these movements will be swiftly arrested and tried for sedition, ensuring that no figurehead remains to inspire further resistance. Martial law will be enforced in areas of persistent unrest, with curfews and military patrols keeping socialist elements in check. Any organizations or publications that spread socialist ideology will be censored or dismantled to prevent further radicalization. The British people must understand that only through strength and discipline can the nation be preserved from the anarchy these revolutionaries seek to impose. By crushing this movement now, the regime ensures that Britain remains firm, orderly, and unwavering in its march toward a stronger future."

 ENG_maintain_a_military_orientated_regime: "Maintain a Military Regime"
 ENG_maintain_a_military_orientated_regime_desc: "The armed forces have secured Britain’s stability, and there is no reason to relinquish control to civilian politicians who would only sow division and weaken our hard-earned order. Nationalist politicians, eager to seize power, call for a return to traditional governance, but their rhetoric threatens to undo the disciplined and structured state we have built. Instead, the military must remain the backbone of the nation, ensuring that all key institutions—from the government to the economy—operate under its firm and rational guidance. Civilian interference, driven by populism and emotion, would only erode the efficiency and unity that military leadership has imposed upon Britain. \n \n To solidify our rule, military officials will be placed in key administrative positions, ensuring that the army’s vision remains paramount in policy-making. Dissent within the ranks of government will be swiftly addressed, with subversive elements removed before they can undermine the regime’s authority. Political parties, if they are to exist at all, must serve as mere advisory bodies, with no power to challenge military governance. The public must be reminded that it was the army, not self-serving politicians, that saved Britain from chaos, and it will continue to do so. By securing our control over all aspects of the state, we ensure that Britain remains powerful, efficient, and unburdened by the failings of civilian rule."
 ENG_calm_down_the_english_church: "Calm Down the English Church"
 ENG_calm_down_the_english_church_desc: "In response to the growing tensions between Fuller's regime and the English Church, it has become clear that stabilizing the relationship with the clergy is essential for maintaining social cohesion and avoiding further unrest. The Church, deeply entrenched in British society, sees the increasing influence of Aleister Crowley and the regime's authoritarian shift as a direct challenge to its authority and influence over the nation. A decisive move must be made to assure the Church that it remains a pillar of moral guidance in the nation and that its role is secure under Fuller's leadership. \n \n By offering concessions, such as a guarantee of religious freedoms and ensuring that the Church retains control over its own affairs, Fuller can defuse the mounting criticism. The regime must also publicly reaffirm its commitment to the Christian values that have historically underpinned British society, distancing itself from any perceived occult or heretical movements. This focus would involve diplomatic outreach to Church leaders, including high-profile meetings with the Archbishop of Canterbury and other influential clerics, to ensure their concerns are addressed and their support is won. While Fuller's military rule will remain intact, it will be important to project an image of unity between the Church and state, reassuring the populace that religious institutions will not be undermined."
 ENG_appease_crowleys_occultists: "Appease Crowley's Occultists"
 ENG_appease_crowleys_occultists_desc: "As part of Fuller's leadership coalition, Aleister Crowley holds significant influence, particularly within the occult and intellectual circles. His views, often controversial, are gaining traction, and his philosophical influence could prove invaluable to the stability of Fuller's regime. However, appeasing Crowley requires a delicate balance, as his radical ideas challenge traditional societal norms and, most notably, the English Church. The clergy, already wary of Fuller's militaristic approach, now sees Crowley’s growing power as a direct threat to their religious authority. Despite this, Fuller's regime recognizes the strategic advantage of aligning with Crowley’s network of followers, especially in consolidating power and ensuring unity within the military and political elite. By offering Crowley greater recognition and freedom, Fuller hopes to placate his more vocal supporters and gain crucial influence in occult and intellectual circles that could aid in the regime's long-term goals. Crowley’s presence as a symbol of defiance against traditional structures could serve as both a unifying and destabilizing force, which Fuller intends to harness. \n \n  The appeasement could create a unique cultural shift, blending occultism with the state’s military power in a way that resonates with a broader population."
 ENG_strenghten_fullers_grip_on_the_coalition: "Strenghten Fuller's Grip on the Coalition"
 ENG_strenghten_fullers_grip_on_the_coalition_desc: "Though the coalition that brought J.F.C. Fuller to power is strong, it remains fragile, held together by competing ambitions and ideological divides. While some within the government see Fuller as a necessary military leader, others whisper about alternatives—about the need for a stronger civilian hand or a more radical vision for Britain’s future. This must be addressed before dissent turns into outright defiance. By consolidating his authority, Fuller will remind his allies that the state is only stable under firm military leadership. Rival factions will be pressured into compliance, whether through persuasion, sidelining, or outright coercion. The influence of unreliable figures will be curtailed, ensuring that Fuller alone directs the course of the nation. While this may alienate some within the coalition, it is a necessary step to prevent internal collapse. A house divided cannot stand, and Fuller will not allow Britain to be governed by uncertainty. Those who seek to undermine his rule will find that the grip of the military does not loosen—it only tightens."
