 lux.1.t: "The Elections of 1922"
 lux.1.d: "It is time for new elections in this year of 1922, that many believe will become a year of many crises. The situation is tense as the LSAP and the PD face off in many discussions, one being conservative and the other social democrat. The race will surely be close, even though most are expecting a conservative landslide. It remains to be seen who will win. If there is no clear winner... then there are rumours that the Royal Family might intervene."
 lux.1.a: "The Conservatives Retain Power"
 lux.1.b: "The Social Democrats Win"
 lux.1.c: "No Winner, the Duchess Seizes Control"
 lux.2.a: "Focus on Internal Stability"
 lux.2.b: "Speak out against the French"
 lux.2.t: "A Royal Tour"
 lux.2.d: "As the Royal Tour of her highness Duchess Charlotte begins she must choose what to talk about in her lenghty speeches. Two major ideas have been recommended by her advisors, one being to talk about uniting the nation and increasing stability and the other being to criticize the Government of Francois Coty in order to increase readiness for war. It ultimately remains the choice of the Duchess what she will say. So what will we do?"
 lux.3.t: "Luxembourg Demands East Wallonie"
 lux.3.d: "The Luxembourgian Duchess has demanded we hand over lands which many consider to be Greater Luxembourg. Our entire government is raging, but some would say with the increased military readiness of Luxembourg it might not even be worth it to try and defend the already german speaking regions. What should we do?"
 lux.3.a: "We have to hand it over"
 lux.3.b: "This is our land, not theirs"
 lux.4.t: "The Worker's Question"
 lux.4.d: "Because of our economic situation, many workers have taken to the street and promote dangerous communist and anarchist ideas. They must be stopped one way or the other. We have two options to do this. Firstly, we could just do what they want and give them more rights, which will effectively end their issues, or we can take a harder approach and break their strikes."
 lux.4.a: "Fine, Appease Them"
 lux.4.b: "Break their Strikes"

 LUX_victory_of_the_lsap: "Victory of the LSAP"
 LUX_the_coup_of_the_duchess: "The Duchess's Coup"
 LUX_the_coup_of_the_duchess_desc: "Luxembourg has a long and rich history, stretching back to the Middle Ages, and being an integral part of the Holy Roman Empire. The Royal Family is the personification of the days of old, and our former glory. The Dutchess is not just a ruler: it is a symbol of our small yet proud home. We need to bring back the Royal Family, even with a coup, to guide back Luxembourg to it's path of greatness, free from the extremist threat surronding us."
 LUX_arrest_the_communists: "Arrest the Communists"
 LUX_arrest_the_communists_desc: "The Communists are a menace, wherever they go. They claim to help the common folk, and yet all their actions end in mass murder, forced seizing of wealth from innocent, hardworking people, and destroying historical memorials, erasing our proud heritage. We don't need the red menace whithin our borders, it's time to take action against the unruly Bolsheviks and jail their leaders. Cutting off the head of the snake ensures that their rampage will end, at least whithin our borders."
 LUX_build_the_defenses_of_the_nation: "Build the Defences of the Nation"
 LUX_build_the_defenses_of_the_nation_desc: "Our nation may be small and our people few, but this cannot stop us from being well-armed. If we want to survive stuck between many greater powers, we need to have the proper means of self-defense. Armanent factories and fortifications will ensure our well-preparedness, both in defensive and even in offensive ways."

 LUX_demand_our_old_lands: "Claim Our Old Lands"
 LUX_demand_our_old_lands_desc: "The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg used to control many more territories. Our current borders are a shame, and we should make it clear to the world that we want a place in the sun. Otherwise, the Greater Powers like Germany and France will trample over us easily."
