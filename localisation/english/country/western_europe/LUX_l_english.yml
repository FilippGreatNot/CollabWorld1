 lux.1.t: "The Elections of 1922"
 lux.1.d: "It is time for new elections in this year of 1922, that many believe will become a year of many crises. The situation is tense as the LSAP and the PD face off in many discussions, one being conservative and the other social democrat. The race will surely be close, even though most are expecting a conservative landslide. It remains to be seen who will win. If there is no clear winner... then there are rumours that the Royal Family might intervene."
 lux.1.a: "The Conservatives Retain Power"
 lux.1.b: "The Social Democrats Win"
 lux.1.c: "No Winner, the Duchess Seizes Control"
 lux.2.a: "Focus on Internal Stability"
 lux.2.b: "Speak out against the French"
 lux.2.t: "A Royal Tour"
 lux.2.d: "As the Royal Tour of her highness Duchess Charlotte begins she must choose what to talk about in her lenghty speeches. Two major ideas have been recommended by her advisors, one being to talk about uniting the nation and increasing stability and the other being to criticize the Government of Francois Coty in order to increase readiness for war. It ultimately remains the choice of the Duchess what she will say. So what will we do?"
 lux.3.t: "Luxembourg Demands East Wallonie"
 lux.3.d: "The Luxembourgian Duchess has demanded we hand over lands which many consider to be Greater Luxembourg. Our entire government is raging, but some would say with the increased military readiness of Luxembourg it might not even be worth it to try and defend the already german speaking regions. What should we do?"
 lux.3.a: "We have to hand it over"
 lux.3.b: "This is our land, not theirs"
