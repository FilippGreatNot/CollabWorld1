 ### Ideas ###
 FRA_nationwide_strikes: "Nationwide Strikes"
 FRA_nationwide_strikes_desc: "The socialist scum in our country are holding nationwide strikes which are breaking the economy. If they are not dealt with immedieately, we may suffer the same fate that Russia did. If that were to happen, France would have a truly terrible fate."
 FRA_all_eyes_on_coty: "All Eyes on Coty"
 FRA_all_eyes_on_coty_desc: "Through quick political manuevering and a bit of public support, the perfume businessman Coty built a nationalist movement and seized control of France. He will bring our nation back to its former glory, the glory of the Napoleonic times and all the other times France used to be great. "
 FRA_broken_nation: "Broken Nation"
 FRA_broken_nation_desc: "With Coty taking charge, the democratic coalition escaping to Algiers and the Great War not bringing that many benefits, France is in a very bad situation. Some would even say it is the worst in the nations history after those of the Hundred Years War. In the east is a destroyed Germany, one which might seek revenge. In the north is the dictator Fuller who woud like to continue the Hundred Years War. Everyone around us is insane. We are actually more autistic than all of them, but lets ignore that."
 FRA_anti_socialist_laws: "Anti-Socialist Laws"
 FRA_anti_socialist_laws_desc: "With the streets of France still up in arms, Coty has seized the opportunity to rush through laws targeting leftist movements. He has argued that only through a swift and decisive movement can France hope to quell the socialist and communist revolutionaries out on the streets and ensure that they never again attempt such a plot. Starting today, all socialist and communist organizations are banned and illegal as well as distribution of any sort of media in their support."
 FRA_banned_opposition: "Banned Opposition"
 FRA_destroyed_economy: "Destroyed Economy"
 FRA_destroyed_economy_desc: "Our economy has been destroyed by the Great War and the post-war power struggle. It is neccesary for us to rebuild it. The problems of the economy are a breeding ground for bolshevik ideals which could destroy our country if they were to be let loose."

 ### Focuses ###
 FRA_coty_presidency: "The Coty Presidency"
 FRA_coty_presidency_desc: "The perfume businessman, nationalist journalist and politician Francois Coty has succesfully seized control of the Republic in a time of troubles. The socialists are on the verge of ending France as we know it, the democrats made an exile government in Algiers and the whole economy and France's standing in the world are threatened and ready to explode. Coty will be the savior of France, and he will make sure it stands strong on the world stage once again."
 FRA_nationalists_in_parliament: "Send in the Nationalist Paramilitaries"
 FRA_nationalists_in_parliament_desc: "Throughout the last years, the terrible situation cause by the war caused many farright militias and paramilitaries to form and threaten the Republic. However, now we can actually use them to out favor to absolutely smash the socialist protestors and free France from their red threat. The red flags must burn and the brown and blue ones must rise. Down with Communism!"
 FRA_purge_the_degenerats: "Purge the Degenerates"
 FRA_purge_the_degenerats_desc: "Many people within the institutions of the state are definitely not in our favor. They are disloyal, corrupt and a threat to the glorious nation France is. This of course means they are aligned with Moscow and must be purge this exact second. We will now allow them to coup us. They will be eliminated, imprisoned and shot. We must secure our rule."
 FRA_condemn_the_traitors: "Condemn the Traitors"
 FRA_condemn_the_traitors_desc: "Coty’s takeover might have been successful, but we cannot rest in our laurels and forget those who opposed it. Several government bureaucrats and senators tried standing against the coup, with some of those who managed to escape now even slandering Coty’s leadership. All of France shall be reminded that these men are not any sort patriots, but traitors who stand against her glory."
 FRA_anti_soc_propaganda: "Anti-Socialist Propaganda"
 FRA_anti_soc_propaganda_desc: "Ever since 1917, Coty has known who the greatest enemy of France is, socialism. The weak-willed governments of the past allowed these Russian puppets to freely fester and gather in France, but Coty will not repeat this mistake. Just as he has learnt of the terror and twisted desires of the Bolsheviks, every man and woman in France shall too. Newspapers around the country have been given a new mandate, to spread the news of the red specter from Normandy to Algiers."
 FRA_ban_sfoi: "Ban the SFIO"
 FRA_ban_sfoi_desc: "The SFIO stands as one of Coty’s largest enemies in France as the nation’s foremost leftist party, and that is not something that can be tolerated. Already most of its leadership has been imprisoned since the coup, but the party at large has been left intact. We cannot let them regroup and once more become a menace, instead it’s time to finally formalize their end, legally banning it and cracking down on its members. Resistance will be stiff, but that hasn’t stopped Coty before."
 FRA_calm_down_the_republic: "Calm down the Public"
 FRA_calm_down_the_republic_desc: "Just as expected, the nation at large has exploded into rioting and strikes following the ban on the SFIO. Now comes the time to counterattack these wannabe revolutionaries. The army will be deployed to break these masses, and our own supporters will be given free reign in helping to suppress them. Finally, Coty will make sure to comfort the people in these trying times, becoming their savior from a repeat of 1917 in France. The nation shall be tamed through the bayonet and the pen."
 FRA_spread_nationalist_propaganda: "Spread Nationalist Propaganda"
 FRA_spread_nationalist_propaganda_desc: "We can crack as many protestors as we want, but one can’t merely beat down an idea. In order for the specter of communism to be exorcised from the French mind, something else has to take its place and thrive, or at least so Coty says. So just as the newspapers were once given orders to scream about the evils of Marx, they must now also begin singing Coty’s praises and calling for a rejuvenation of France to a stature befitting its past glory."
 FRA_deal_with_traitors: "Deal with Traitors"
 FRA_deal_with_traitors_desc: "With the current prisons overcrowded with everything from leftists to those who opposed the takeover, it is clear that a more permanent solution must be worked out. To alleviate this issue, the greatest offenders among them shall be executed at once, and the Frenchmen that remain shall be sent to new labor camps to be of use to France. These men and women will serve as a clear example of what is to happen to those that oppose France’s new future, and their absence will barely be remembered."
 FRA_gather_military_support: "Gather Military Support"
 FRA_gather_military_support_desc: "Within the military, there are still elements which oppose our rule and seek to end our regime. We must get them on our side and prove to them that Coty will lead France to military supremacy."
 FRA_implement_the_cherbourg_laws: "Implement the Cherbourg Laws"
 FRA_implement_the_cherbourg_laws_desc: "Coty has spent the last couple of months molding the French state into a boot with which he can squash his opponents, and so far, this has been reserved for the leftist movements inside the nation. Now, however, he has decided to begin targeting his other perceived enemy, French jews. The Cherbourg Laws are a set of new laws discriminating against Jews living within the nation, effectively turning them into second class citizens through segregating them away from the rest of French society and economy."
 FRA_return_to_traditional_values: "Return to Traditional Values"
 FRA_return_to_traditional_values_desc: "The Third Republic is weak. It has let its institutions, and its society, grow decadent and traitorous of itself. After all, did France not suffer the most in the Great War because its own soldiers, the men who should love her the most, began mutinying against their superiors? This cannot go on. If the nation is to once more recover its glory it must embrace the values that gave it strength to march all the way to Moscow once upon a time and get rid of all its modernist weakness."
 FRA_suppress_freedom_of_speech: "Supress Fredom of Speech"
 FRA_suppress_freedom_of_speech_desc: "There have been quite a few writers and editors that have taken a strong dislike for the government’s new orders to the newspapers, and in turn have made their opinions heard through their papers. It appears as though these men do not understand what an order means and are in need of a reminder. Through a new set of laws, these men are now traitors to the state, and so will anyone else who dares utter a word against Coty’s rule."
 FRA_emergency_presidential_power: "Emergency Presidential Powers"
 FRA_emergency_presidential_power_desc: "If Coty could have his way completely intact, he would rip apart the constitution of the third republic and start completely anew, but he cannot do so without threatening to spark yet another series of massive strikes and protests. Instead, he will pursue his dreams of a stronger presidency through giving himself emergency presidential powers. Of course, he will claim that they are merely to help guide the nation through turbulent times, he just won’t ever claim that the turbulent times have ended."
 FRA_viva_la_coty: "Viva Coty!"
 FRA_viva_la_coty_desc: "Coty is the greatest leader in Modern French History. He has fixed the economy and ended the socialist threat which plagued the nation after the war. Long live Coty! He will go and re-establish French World Hegemony. France is the greatest nation in the world, and no one can change that fact. Long live Coty! Long live France!"
 FRA_ban_all_opposition_parties: "Ban the Opposition"
 FRA_ban_all_opposition_parties_desc: "In a way it is amusing for Coty to see how the centrist opposition to his rule was so cooperative. They have eagerly danced to the tune he played for them, believing his tales of subversion and revolution by first the communists and then the Jews. They have thought so far that if they seemed innocent and played along that they would escape his wrath. They have always been wrong. And as they have never spoken up for no one else, there is no one left to speak up for them now."
 FRA_take_full_control: "Take Full Control"
 FRA_take_full_control_desc: "Over the last few years, we have sucessfully seized control of the Republic and made it into a strong French state ready to expand its influence abroad and provide the French Citizens with a good way of life. Our leader Coty is the one who made all this possible, so we should make a statue to honor him and his works. Viva Coty! Long live France!"
 FRA_acknowledge_the_economic_clusterfuck: "Acknowledge the Economic Clusterfuck"
 FRA_acknowledge_the_economic_clusterfuck_desc: "The recent coup has left France’s economy in a state of limbo at the worst possible moment. France was already mired in debt following the great war and a half-hazard demobilization left millions unemployed, but the coup has only made things more confusing. Coty has so far kept himself away from matters of the economy, leaving it to chug along same as before while being uncertain that it should be doing so. No more. Coty has called on his inner circle and has declared that he will soon take the economy in a new direction. "
 FRA_the_people_first: "The People First"
 FRA_the_people_first_desc: "If we truly want to gain the support of the French People, we should prioritize their wellbeing instead of implementing radical hardcore measures which endanger it. The French People are France, so therefore they shall be our outmost priority as we try to heal the wounds of the economic crisis. Let's begin."
 FRA_fake_the_numbers: "Fake the Numbers"
 FRA_fake_the_numbers_desc: "Despite our best efforts, the economy is still having clear problems. In order to convince the more skeptic parts of our population about our economic plans and the international community as well, we will just fake the statistics and make it seem as if the economy is actually growing and the crisis is over while in reality there is still a long way until it is solved."
 FRA_ban_the_labor_unions: "Ban the Labor Unions"
 FRA_ban_the_labor_unions_desc: "One of Coty’s greatest opponents since taking power has been no other than the Labor Unions, an understandable stance given their prior connections to the SFIO, but still a constant issue for the new regime. Coty will thus kill two birds with one stone through their banning, disbanding a potential enemy, and pleasing the business interests that helped him get into power."
 FRA_implement_autarky_measures: "French Autarky"
 FRA_implement_autarky_measures_desc: "The truth is, France has to be an independent economic state, even if that means hurting our population. The Economic Crisis must be dealt with harshly in a quick swoop, there is no time to waste. We must get to expanding French Influence abroad."
 FRA_implement_tax_hikes: "Implement Tax Hikes"
 FRA_implement_tax_hikes_desc: "In order for France to be able to quickly pay off its debts at the same time it embarks on Coty’s costly military programs, the state needs a new surge in income, and this shall be done through introducing several new tax hikes. After all, is it not a Frenchman’s duty to lift France up on his shoulders? Every man must learn to sacrifice something for the nation to prosper. And please, ignore Coty’s lack of such sacrifice."
 FRA_cut_education_spending: "Cut Education Spending"
 FRA_cut_education_spending_desc: "Why do we even need education? All people are meant to be used by the state for the greater good anyways. Just cut down the spending, who needs teachers and books? This can't hurt us. A dumb population is actually better, then they won't resist our rule! And it is better for them if they dont resist indeed."
 FRA_national_unemployment_program: "National Unemployment Program"
 FRA_national_unemployment_program_desc: "Unemployment is a plague upon the nation, and welfare for such parasites of society merely places a burden on the state. To correct the squalor and vagrancy that has spread in France following the great war, Coty will ensure that every Frenchman is employed and providing to the state. Men will be funneled into the new armament factories and be put to toil in new infrastructure programs until not a single beggar bother’s the great leader’s sight. Under Coty’s watch, no Frenchman will leave France behind."
 FRA_the_fires_extinguished: "The Fires Extinguished"
 FRA_the_fires_extinguished_desc: "Honestly this time, France’s economic crisis has finally abated. Although no public victory can be celebrated given our previous fake proclamation of victory, the invisible results speak for themselves. Once more, France can stand tall on the world stage as its economy sees growth and the unemployment caused by demobilization dwarfs. And who to thank other than the glorious leader Coty?"
 FRA_cut_military_spending: "Cut Military Spending"
 FRA_cut_military_spending_desc: "Now, seeing the state of the world, you might think it would be a bad idea to cut our Military Spending. Our wise leader Francois Coty begs go differ. If we want the longterm support of our people, we must make them believe that we are far from being the aggresors and that we care about them. That is the key to a succesful nation. Coty's plan is opposed by many generals but welcomed highly by the Paramilitaries who will only profit from the plan. In total, hopefully this will lead us to a more prosperous economy for France."
 FRA_nationalize_private_assets: "Nationalize Important Assets"
 FRA_nationalize_private_assets_desc: "There are many private Assets in France that should be nationalized to help us heal from the economic crisis, especially the ones from foreign countries like Switzerland. The Swiss are the root of all evils. This plan might go against our typical economic orientation, but it's simply the best choice in these challenging times."
 FRA_cotys_infrastructure_plans: "Coty's Infrastructure Plans"
 FRA_cotys_infrastructure_plans_desc: "France will not only be the center of Europe, but also the center of the world. To Prepare the nation for its destiny we must build new Infrastructure to help connect the French State. This will grant us great economic benefits both short term and long term. Let's get to work!"
 FRA_the_inflation_reduction_act: "Inflation Reduction Act"
 FRA_the_inflation_reduction_act_desc: "Through the increase of taxes and the slashing of useless programs such as education, France is seeing a budget surplus for the first time in years. While some frivolous minds now want us to waste away this money in ridiculous welfare and once more trigger inflation to grow, more regime-oriented minds know that this surplus will be best spent funding rearmament and repaying France’s debts. To keep this positive tide flowing, a new inflation reduction act will expand Coty’s welfare cuts. "
 FRA_liquidate_unprofitable_assets: "Liquidize Unprofitable Assets"
 FRA_liquidate_unprofitable_assets_desc: "There are many state industries that are not a benefit but a burden to France and its taxpayers. But merely closing these companies and leaving their factories to rust is no solution at all, instead these companies will be dissolved and their assets sold to more capable private companies. Perhaps these factories are sold at a price lower than their estimated values, and perhaps their new owners are old friends of Coty, but such are not things to be worried about."
 FRA_france_on_the_world_stage: "France on the World Stage"
 FRA_france_on_the_world_stage_desc: "France is far gone from the humiliation it suffered last century. She now stands proud as one of the victors of the bloodiest war in history, even plunging her most ancient enemy into a civil war as she stands triumphant. But now that the Hun has been defeated there are other enemies France must vanquish. Coty will make one thing clear to all the world, France is the hegemon of western Europe, and she has no equals."
 FRA_into_the_benelux: "Into the Benelux"
 FRA_into_the_benelux_desc: "France might have recovered what Bismark stole from her during the Great War, but this is not the only humiliation she has undergone. It was perfidious Albion which stripped France of the greatest empire she ever had, that of Napoleon. This humiliation too must be reversed, but France must do so carefully. Luxembourg is the perfect start to this reclamation, serving as a good indication of whether any power will oppose France’s expansionism in the Benelux. "
 FRA_destroy_the_false_state: "Destroy the Fake State"
 FRA_destroy_the_false_state_desc: "Our annexation of Luxembourg has proven that no one in the world is willing to stop -nor even protest- France’s rightful conquests. In such a case there is no time to waste, more conquest awaits us. Belgium is a land of French speakers, a land that Napoleon once rightfully incorporated into France only to be cut off by the whims of a fearful Europe. This “state”, barely over a hundred years old, has been a stain on our maps for long enough."
 FRA_reunite_with_the_dutch: "Reunite with the Dutch"
 FRA_reunite_with_the_dutch_desc: "The Dutch have always been a sisterly nation to France. They were our first Sister Republic after France’s own Revolution, and later a part of Napoleon’s Empire. The Dutch and French have always been a people separated by circumstance but not by spirit, and it is finally time for this physical rift to be mended. Whether the Dutch people believe this too or not is not of particular importance to us."
 FRA_integrate_wallony_and_luxembourg: "Integrate Wallony and Luxembourg"
 FRA_integrate_wallony_and_luxembourg_desc: "For some reason, the French army has been met with disdain or downright hatred by the people of the Benelux. In most places, the population look at our great leader not as a champion, but a mere conquering brute. Thankfully, the people closest to France’s old borders are wiser than their brethren and have dutifully accepted their new government. While the rest of the Benelux shall remain under martial law for the time being, the borderlands of Wallony and Luxembourg are ready to be fully integrated into France."
 FRA_strike_britain: "Strike the British Empire"
 FRA_strike_britain_desc: "The naïve among us will proclaim that Britain isn’t an enemy of France. The downright stupid believe they can still be our allies. The truth is that England has always stood in opposition to any continental hegemon, forever scared that a threat from the continent may one day assault their island. Perfidious Albion cannot be allowed to stand in our path to glory, and Fuller cannot be trusted. Coty shall thus cement France’s new hegemony over western Europe with a feat not even Napoleon accomplished, the conquest of Britain."
 FRA_the_iberian_game: "The Iberian Game"
 FRA_the_iberian_game_desc: "Iberia is a crucial region when it comes to our so called Cold War with the Fullerite Regime in London. In the case of a war, controlling Iberia would allow us to take Gibraltar and have full control over the Atlantic Ocean. By doing this, we can actually challenge British Naval Hegemony and make ourselves a global superpower once again."
 FRA_take_down_spain: "Take Down Spain"
 FRA_take_down_spain_desc: "Back in the Napoleonic Wars, we fought Spain and defeated it in a quick swoop. It was under French control and these times should return. Through a force of arms, we will seize Spain and encircle Gibraltar to prevent the British Dogs from pressuring us."
 FRA_neutralize_portugal: "Neutralize Portugal"
 FRA_neutralize_portugal_desc: "Portugal is a historical ally of Britain. In order to prevent them from allying with Fuller in the case of a regime change, we must neutralize it immedieately and bring it under French rule. This will allow us to dominate their valuable coasts and get a way larger control of the Atlantic Ocean. In general, a great investment when you think about it!"
 FRA_catalonia_and_basque: "Catalonia and Basque"
 FRA_catalonia_and_basque_desc: "France already owns Catalan and Basque speaking lands. Therefore, it shouldn't be that hard for us to integrate the Spanish part directly into France and stabilize it, allowing us to use its rich resources better for our economy and so on. Also, this might put our legacy on Iberia for longer and make it more certain France will control Catalonia and Basque forever."
