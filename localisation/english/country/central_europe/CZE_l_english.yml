### events ###

cze.1.t: "Beer and a couple bullets"
cze.1.d: "In the sound of the Czechoslovak national anthem, a military convoy arrived at the gates of the Prague Castle. In it the soldiers and officers behind the Russian Legion which had just yesterday returned to Prague by multiple planes. In the front stands Radola Gajda and Jan Syrový waiting for the governor Štefánik. The Legionaries are viewed as heroes as now democracy can be restored in the vision of Masaryk. After a night of celebrations, all participants were already half drunk, in the meantime one man had walked right in front of Štefánik. In just a second Štefánik had collapsed on the ground, dead. The two rounds from a revolver could be easily heard and the assassin was immediately caught, but the goal was done, Štefánik was dead. "   
cze.1.a: "He was a good man"

cze.2.t: "Suprising Results"
cze.2.d: "As our investigation went calmly we expected to find the culprits behind the attack quite quickly, the assassin being alive was a massive advantage. We immediately could say that he didn't act on his own and that he was hired to do it. However, as we investigated, the terrible reality became clear: it was the Russian legionaries who were behind the attack on our governor. Their motives were clear, to get rid of the single most popular and powerful person in Czechoslovakia apart from Masaryk to use their fame and get in the government. We could reveal the truth about them and prevent their takeover, but wouldn't that cause more bad?"
cze.2.a: "Better keep quiet"
