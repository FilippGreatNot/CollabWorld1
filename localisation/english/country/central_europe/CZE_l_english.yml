### events ###

cze.1.t: "Beer and a couple bullets"
cze.1.d: "In the sound of the Czechoslovak national anthem, a military convoy arrived at the gates of the Prague Castle. In it the soldiers and officers behind the Russian Legion which had just yesterday returned to Prague by multiple planes. In the front stands Radola Gajda and Jan Syrový waiting for the governor Štefánik. The Legionaries are viewed as heroes as now democracy can be restored in the vision of Masaryk. After a night of celebrations, all participants were already half drunk, in the meantime one man had walked right in front of Štefánik. In just a second Štefánik had collapsed on the ground, dead. The two rounds from a revolver could be easily heard and the assassin was immediately caught, but the goal was done, Štefánik was dead. "   
cze.1.a: "He was a good man"

cze.2.t: "Suprising Results"
cze.2.d: "As our investigation went calmly we expected to find the culprits behind the attack quite quickly, the assassin being alive was a massive advantage. We immediately could say that he didn't act on his own and that he was hired to do it. However, as we investigated, the terrible reality became clear: it was the Russian legionaries who were behind the attack on our governor. Their motives were clear, to get rid of the single most popular and powerful person in Czechoslovakia apart from Masaryk to use their fame and get in the government. We could reveal the truth about them and prevent their takeover, but wouldn't that cause more bad?"
cze.2.a: "Better keep quiet"

cze.3.t: "Elections of a new commander"
cze.3.d: "After our death of our commander Štefánik new commander for our military government had to be elected, our two main candidates both come from the lines of the russian legions, firstly it's Jan Syrový, a conservative wishing to continue the work of Štefánik and help establish democracy, at least we hope so. The second is Radola Gajda, a radical which had based his campaign on uniting slavs under a militarist nationalist empire. The chaos surrounding the elections could however help potentially a third candidate if he had any support from armed group."
cze.3.a: "Vote for Syrový"
cze.3.b: "Vote for Gajda"

cze.4.t: "First meeting of the Legionary Council"
cze.4.d: "After our peaceful takeover, the council of legionaries, led by Štefánik, convened to discuss our future. We had promised to stay in power only as long as needed, but since the foreign situation isn't stabilising we can only wait for our legions stuck in Siberia to help us defend Czechoslovakia."
cze.4.a: "So we wait"

cze.5.t: "Question of the Military"
cze.5.d: "Council convened again to discuss the topic of military, two options had been brought up, either we will strictly stick to our legions or we can choose to completely start over by accepting back czech soldiers which fought in the lines of the imperial army. This a move which could potentially anger our partiotic population."
cze.5.a: "Strong army is our priority"

cze.6.t: "Question of our identity"
cze.6.d: "With our nation being consisted of many strong minorities, it is up to us how to calm our population. Should be become the nation of two minorities and embrace the supremacy of the czechs and slovaks? Or we could give rights to everyone? People need our answer and so we will choose." 
cze.6.a: "Time to build new czechoslovak identity"

cze.7.t: "Meet with Masaryk"
cze.7.d: "As part of his campaign, Syrový went to visit our father-president Masaryk which has abdicated following the November events in Czechoslovakia, then he was succeded by Štefánik. Syrový had went to assure Masaryk he is planning only good for Czechoslovakia and that he will return democracy."
cze.7.a: "Did he knocked before entering?"

cze.8.t: "Second times the charm"
cze.8.d: "After the incredibly close last elections, the two hot candidates had some more time for campaign, but now it was finally time to decide. So will it be Gajda or Syrový?"
cze.8.a: "Syrový shall continue our job"
cze.8.b: "Unite the slavs under Gajda"
