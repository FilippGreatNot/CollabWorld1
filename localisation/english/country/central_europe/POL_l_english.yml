 pol.1.t: "Fate of the PSL"
 pol.1.d: "Currently, the party is divided between the centrist Piast and the more agrarian Wyzwolenie. They are headed by two different men with competing interests, and it is important to maintain a clear balance between the two, so, as are many democratic countries' goals, we need to find a solution to this division, there can only be one PSL, but the answer doesn't have to lie in either Witos or Narutowicz being dead."

 pol.2.t: "The General Election awaits its results"
 pol.2.d: "Today is a special day for Poland; its first ever elections; Wybory Narodowe. It is time for the people to select their candidates on the ballot and await the conclusion. But only one candidate will be the winner. The difficulty that Poland faces is in its democratic model, where parties are given proportional representation and thus are not bound by a two-party duality and are more tied to the people's support, meaning that a lean-left party might get the plural vote one year, and a centre-right one on the other. It is important to consider who you're partnering up too, as coalitions are very important. Now, its time to skip the rest of the yap, and get on with it!"
