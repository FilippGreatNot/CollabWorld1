There are multiple factions inside the country that want to overthrow the Batka, and some kind of attempt to murder Makhno is inevitable. Will we overcome this crisis or is the anarchist revolution doomed?"

UKR_our_way: "Choosing Our Way"
UKR_our_way_desc: "Many people in Ukraine think Ukraine should have a different destiny.

The reds and the whites have to go!"

UKR_or: "Or?..."
UKR_com: "The Ukrainian Red Revolution"

However, some people think Shumsky has bigger plans than being integrated into the new Soviet state."
UKR_white: "White Takeover in Ukraine"
UKR_white_desc: "With the support of the Armed Forces of Southern Russia, the Ukrainian Whites have succesfuly overthrown the Ukrainian Black Army after the assasination of Nesto Makhno threw the country into total chaos.

### Events ###
ukr.startbranch.1.t: "Flimsy stability in our nation"
ukr.startbranch.1.d: "Our revolution has just begun; with Soviet support Mahkno succeded to take control of all of Ukraine. Yet still Ukraine is a large country to build an anarchist society in. Not only have we destroyed our industry from the inside, but the people who don't support an anarchist revolution also resist our rule. This increases the risks of a popular uprising against the black army, which could one day throw Ukraine into a full fledged civil war or a second revolution. The future is uncertain."
ukr.startbranch.1.a: "The situation is visibly complicated."
ukr.startbranch.2.t: "The Batka doesn't feel Confident"
ukr.startbranch.2.d: "Not only has our Batka begun to receive threats from communists and monarchists, but his own advisors are eyeing his position as the leader of the Ukrainian Black Army. Makhno isn't scared, but he certainly isn't confident in his ability to keep Ukraine stable. Something bad is brewing behind the scenes."
ukr.startbranch.2.a: "Even more purging?"
ukr.startbranch.3.t: "Our Way"
ukr.startbranch.3.d: "Ukraine is still filled with people with various different views on the world. We have monarchists, communists and democrats all trying to overthrow Nesto Makhno. On top of that, the so called German Garrison is also starting problems on the countryside. Many people are even beginning to develop new ideologies which are completely different from our anarchist ideal."
ukr.startbranch.3.a: "§ONational Bolshevism?§!"
ukr.startbranch.4.t: "Our Country's Growth"
ukr.startbranch.4.d: "Since the end of the civil war, Nestor Makhno never left his office in Kyiv, but his regime can fall any second if he doesn't take any actions, so without telling his advisors he decided to take a trip to Chernigov. There he will try to stabilize the local situation and rally the people behind our glorious anarchist cause. For the Worker!"
ukr.startbranch.4.a: "What can go wrong? Right?"
ukr.startbranch.5.t: "A Speech in Chernigov"
ukr.startbranch.5.d: "§R'NASTAL NASH CZAS'§! shouted Nestor. At the end of the speech, something terrible happened, the grim reaper came and tried to take our Batka's soul, as the knife entered his chest from the back, litres of blood spitted out of his breast as he fell on the ground, thousands of people watching as their great anarchic leader died in front of them. The silence was so deep that people could hear the blood droplets falling from the murderer's knife. No one knew the murderer, nor who he supports nor why he killed the Batka, but that was something someone really wanted to know. After the guards took a look at Makhno, it was uncertain whether he was breathing."
ukr.sb.5.a: "HAHAHA! MOTHER ANARCHY WINS ONCE AGAIN! Makhno Lives!"
ukr.sb.5.b: "Makhno is dead. The Bolsheviks overthrow the government!"
ukr.sb.5.c: "Makhno is dead. The whites take over the country!"
ukr_soc.0.t: "Communist Takeover in Ukraine!"
ukr_soc.0.d: "This morning, when 'Batko' Makhno was celebrating Ukraine's independence with his fellow anarchists, an assassinator, who claimed to be white, shot Nestor Makhno with his colt 1911! Shocked with this new but united by spirit the Ukrainian communists took this opportunity and claimed the whites to be a threat to Ukrainian nation, so the self announced leader of Ukraine Alexander Shumsky took a chance to spread communism to Ukraine. With the communist party behind him and the people optimistic, Shumsky is ready to change Ukraine's destiny forever. How this destiny will look is the real question."
ukr_soc.0.a: "The Fire Rises Indeed."
ukr_soc.1.t: "Incoming Call from Moscow"
ukr_soc.1.d: "Today is a very important day, as today we have to decide, whether we would follow Moscow way to start revolution, or shall we start our own, victorous revolution, and not help russia to reunificate, choice is absolutely ours"

ukr_soc.5.t: "The German Problem"
ukr_soc.5.d: "After the Great War, in order to compensate their help, Germans send a garrison to ensure our loyalty, now that the German man is dead, it's time to get rid of them"
ukr_soc.5.a: "Shoot them, now and forever"
ukr_soc.5.b: "They will be great soldiers.."
ukr_soc.6.t: "Our Industrial State"
ukr_soc.6.d: "Our economy is in ruins after Makhno's anarchy, when mercenaries went around and burned every factory we have, so now we have to decide: how are we going to fix our industry? Would it be a harsh forced industrialisation or should we integrate agrarian fields into our economy and base it around our farmers?"
ukr_soc.6.a: "forced industrialisation"
ukr_soc.6.b: "agrarian economy"
ukr_soc.9.t: "Western rebels rise up in Ukraine!"
ukr_soc.9.d: "Straight after Ukrainian communist revolution, the great purge began, and many minorities such as pro-white west, were very unhappy, and today, Andrey Melnyk, the leader of Ukrainian nationalist party, began second Ukrainian revolution and mobilized forces in the western provinces, he called the new government 'Second Republic of Ukraine'. The fire rises on."
ukr_soc.9.a: "What's going on in Ukraine?"
ukr_soc.11.t: "They accepted our demands!"
ukr_soc.11.a: "We got Crimea and Kuban back!"

#tukha doesnt join
ukr_soc.18.t: "Tukhachevsky has declined our proposition."
ukr_soc.18.a: "§RThen we shall have his blood!§!"
ukr_soc.19.t: "The bastards from Moscow rejected our proposition!"
ukr_soc.19.d: "Those damn Bolsheviks in Moscow, what are they thinking? We could have created a beautiful union between our two states and they have the gall to reject our proposal almost immediately! It looks like we'll have to unite with them by force, we must build up the military and economy as soon as possible."
ukr_soc.19.a: "Good Riddance!"
ukr_soc.20.t: "Tukhachevsky Joins Forces with the Ukrainian Soviet Republic"
ukr_soc.20.d: "Today, peculiar news have come from Eastern Europe. Mikhail Tukhachevsky, in a move that is unprecedented knowing his personality, decided to swear loyalty to the Communist Government in Kiev. The event is viewed by experts as a miracle for Ukraine as they just doubled their amount of control. Now they face new challenges, but they have way better chances of being their own force for the Reunification of Russia. Will this event bring peace to Eastern Europe, or is war on the horizon?"
ukr_soc.20.a: "What Was Tukhachevsky Thinking?"
ukr_soc.21.a: "We will integrate those anarchists into a more stable army"
ukr_soc.21.b: "We will kill all of those who will stay to their principle of anarchy"
ukr_soc_sov.1.t: "Russian regime intervenes in our government!"
ukr_soc_sov.1.d: "Khruschevsky overtook our regime and now he is in charge of the country, this is a bad sign as we might get annexed soon by the Russian SFSR"
ukr_soc_sov.1.a: "Is this the end?"
ukr_soc_sov.2.t: "The Russian SFSR integration process is complete."
ukr_soc_sov.2.d: "As of today, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic has finalised the process for army and administration to integrate within the Russian SFSR! Nikita Khrushchev delivered his speech in front of the Supreme Soviet to an eager crowd of listeners, the speech broadcasting all over the nation with workers and peasants tuning in too. \"Today we join with our comrades in the Russian SFSR, soon all of Russia will be united and we can reach a state of prosperity!\"."
ukr_soc_sov.2.a: "§RMoya Rodina Sovetsky Soyuz!§!"
ukr_soc.22.t: "The Great Eastern Backstab"
ukr_soc.22.d: "In an extremely wld turn of events, the Ukrainian Soviet Republic has gone against all the expectations of the international community. After taking control of the eastern realm of the former Russian Empire, they've decided to strike down the regime in Moscow which they claim has betrayed Lenin's ideals and become counter-revolutionary and even reactionary. They've taken the mantle of the Red Revolution. All odds are against them, but maybe they can succeed in their very bold objective anyways? Time will tell. For now, one thing is certain: Eastern Europe bleeds."
ukr_soc.22.a: "This was not on this year's Bingo card"
