Shocked with this new but united by spirit communists took this opportunity and claimed white to be a threat to Ukrainian nation, so self announced leader of Ukraine Alexander Shumsky, took a chance to stabilize rule of communism over the east, where now he promises to deal with separatists and lead Ukraine to greater future!"

The event is viewed by experts as a miracle for Ukraine as they just doubled their amount of control. Now they face new challenges, but they have way better chances of being their own force for the Reunification of Russia. Will this event bring peace to Eastern Europe, or is war on the horizon?"
