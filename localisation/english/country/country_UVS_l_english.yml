At one side is the current leader Rosa Luxemburg who may be considered the center by some. Then there is her long time friend Karl Liebknecht who supports more democratic policies. Of course, there is also the USPD that wants to build a new mix between a parliamentary system and the Rätersystem. On the complete opposite side of the spectrum is the nationalist, schizophrenic in the minds of some, Joachim von Ribentrop. Less radical than him is the heavily Soviet-Aligned Ernst Thälmann who wants to pursue cooperation with the Russians. Now that the congress has ended, we can see who won...  "
