With the help of God and our guns, we will throw that bolshevik muscovite Mikhail Tukhachevsky back to Russia! Fight, and do not be afraid! We will win this fight for freedom as we have won many others. The Ukrainians and the Bermontians march against Tukhachevsky too, this will be an easy fight which we must endure! Poland, Arise!"

 tukha.3.d: "We didn't suceed in beating the Polish rebellion"
 tukha.3.a: "Is this the end?"
 tukha.4.t: "Tukhachevsky Gave In!"
 tukha.4.d: "Clearly seeing the situation on the battlefield, Mikhail Tukhachevsky has decided to give up and let us walk away with our independence without a real fight. The 10 day war which we fought against the regime hasn't seen that much consequences. Friends, it is time to heal and build! It is time to establish a truly great and independent Polish State!"
 tukha.4.a: "Poland Has Returned!"
 tukha.5.t: "The Question of Alignment"
 tukha.5.d: "The district needs to decide where its loyalties lie. We are the frontier of the Russian Revolution, but our marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky does indeed have his own ideas and ambitions. If we stay loyal to Moscow, we will inevitably end up annexed and our future will be in the Union. However, if we are loyal to the Red Napoleon, we can take the reins of the Revolution and reunite Russia as we wish."

 tukha.6.t: "The Failed Land Reforms"
 tukha.6.d: "The mismanagement of the Russian Empire has left this land in an economic crisis of the likes never seen before. On top of that, the early mismanagement of our own administration has only worsened the situation as we failed to glue the problem. We must decide what to do. We can either embrace our current plan and hope it works out, or we can throw it out all together and adapt to the realities of Poland."

 tukha.7.t: "The Polish Resistance"
 tukha.7.d: "After our victory at the Vistula, the Poles quickly formed a resilient movement which seeks to kick us out and re-establish an independent Polish state free of communism. These men, while brave, have done a major mistake. They underestimate the genius and power of our marshal Tukhachevsky. In this context, we have two choices. We can either attempt to win over their hearts or make their hearts bleed in order to get them to submit. What should we do?"
 tukha.7.a: "We must teach them!"

 tukha.8.t: "Mikhail Tukhachevsky Unites the Soviet Union"
 tukha.8.d: "News have come from the Kremlin that the Soviet Marshal has declared the old territories of the Russian Empire to be reunified under the control of the Soviet Union. This comes after the Red Army had dealt with the last pockets of the White Army in Siberia and defeated all warlords across the Russian Realm. Tukhachevsky's regime is often characterized as extremely brutal and often militaristic. Is there a future in which Russia is prosperous?"
 tukha.8.a: "The Red Napoleon"
 tukha.9.t: "The Issues at Hand"
 tukha.9.d: "At the moment, we face multiple issues in our quest to stabilize Poland. Firstly, the failed land reforms of the Russian Empire and our subsequent takeover did not work whatsoever. We need to find a solution for the land ownership problem in Poland. On top of that, a Resistance has formed which is loyal to Pilsudski and seeks to oust Tukhachevsky from power. And lastly but not least, we need to decide where our loyalties lie in the struggle to unify Russia."
 tukha.9.a: "Well, interesting."
 tukha.10.t: "A Call with the Boss"
 tukha.10.d: "Today, Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Vladimir Lenin talked on a call. Tukhachevsky explained the situation in Poland to Lenin, and he wasn't very excited to hear about all the problems the District is facing. Lenin promised support so long as Tukhachevsky goes along with the policies of the Communist Party. However, some people have started to question Tukhachevsky's loyalty to the Father of the Revolution..."
 tukha.10.a: "We will Serve the Revolution!"
 tukha.11.t: "The Awakening of Perun"
 tukha.11.d: "The Skies are talking to me. They know who I am. I am Perun. I am invincible. I am immortal. I am Mikhail Tukhachevsky. I must realize my true self. I must serve the Rod. Russia will rise again."
 tukha.11.a: "Slava Rodu!"
 tukha.11.b: "I shouldn't end up like Ribentrop..."
