 ## Leader Descriptions ##
 POLITICS_TUKHACHEVSKY_DESC: "Mikhail Tukhachevsky, born into an atheistic aristocrat family, has become the Hero of the Russian Revolution. His military prowess in defending the Revolution gained him the nickname of the Red Napoleon. While many of his operations did fail due to the corruption of the party and the disloyalty of the officers, he was able to, against all odds, defeat Marshal Pilsudski and reveal his true potential to the world. This is what got him his nickname. Now, he faces a unique challenge: ruling over a country." 
 POLITICS_TUKHACHEVSKY_PAGAN_DESC: "Mikhail "Perun" Tukhachevsky- the Red Napoleon, the Red Alexander. As a young boy, Mikhail was never afraid of thunder- he would look out of his window during a thunderstorm and admire how the lightning bolts struck down the trees from across the lake, the colossal noise thundering, shaking the foundations of his family home. His memories of those bright bolts of energy with immense power, have stuck with him ever since. Mikhail found his calling, his idol, his indentity, and his deity- he discovered the only God in this fucked up world worth worshipping. §RSLAVA PERUN-SLAVA RODU!§!"

 ### Ideas ###
 BLR_polish_resistance_desc: "Despite our victory at the Vistula, the Poles continue to be fierce in their reactionary resistance against our regime. We must squash their little movement before they get close to taking over the country once again. This should be our top priority."
 
 BLR_failed_land_reforms: "Failed Land Reforms"
 BLR_failed_land_reforms_desc: "Despite our best efforts, we haven't been able to fix the mess left in Poland by the administrators of the old Russian Empire. The situation is chaotic and the bureaucracy is suffering extensively. We need to immediately deal with the land reforms issue, or our fracturing economy will be permanently broken."
 
 BLR_failed_land_reforms2: "Discontinued Land Reforms"
 BLR_failed_land_reforms2_desc: "We have cut down some of major aspects of the reforms and it has given us some breathing room, but it isn't enough to effectively revitalise our economy."
 
 BLR_failed_land_reforms3: "Bureaucratic Central Economy"
 BLR_failed_land_reforms3_desc: "Our administration and economy work together, but not without their issues. We will still have a ways to go before we can call our economy 'perfect'."
 
 BLR_an_army_with_a_state: "An Army with a State"
 BLR_an_army_with_a_state_desc: "While we have won the war over the poles, we have not won the war over governance; Many aspects of our state are still strictly confined by war-time policies and an unsustainable administrative structure. We are overburdened, and we are overstretched, even if our army is one of the best there is."
 
 BLR_soviet_economic_support: "Soviet Economic Support"
 BLR_soviet_economic_support_desc: "Socialism knows no bounds, but so does poverty! We have accepted Soviet Aid to help support us in these trying times, and to help develop our economy. While this may increase our dependence on them, it also decreases the likelihood of them invading us, which is always a big bonus when you're surrounded on all sides by enemies."
 
 BLR_loyal_polish_workers: "New Soviet Man"
 BLR_loyal_polish_workers_desc: "A Key part in lowering resistance by peaceful means is building upon the trust and loyalty of our citizens. Simple revolutionaries will not do!

 BLR_healthy_soldiers: "Healthy Soldiers"
 BLR_healthy_soldiers_desc: "Keeping the soldiers healthy and happy are fundamental to a functioning professional army, especially if it comes to one as big as ours. People can easily become injured or caught in the crossfire, and thus it is not only important to our soldiers but also ourselves that we develop a safety net in medical care for our officers."
 
 BLR_deep_battle_tactics: "Deep Battle Theory"
 BLR_deep_battle_tactics_desc: "Our Deep Battle doctrine focuses on breaking enemy defenses in multiple layers, using armoured and mechanises forces, artillery bombardments, and close air support to strike deep into and beyond the frontline. By disrupting enemy reinforcements and supply lines, we prevent them from regrouping, ensuring our relentless advance."
 
 BLR_red_army_doctrine: "Red Army Doctrine"
 BLR_red_army_doctrine_desc: "The Red Army has simplified the process of developing and refining military strategies by focusing on streamlined research.

 BLR_red_army_doctrine2: "Red Army Doctrine"
 BLR_red_army_doctrine2_desc: "The Red Army has simplified the process of developing and refining military strategies by focusing on streamlined research.

 BLR_politicized_army_academia: "Political Commissars"
 BLR_politicized_army_academia_desc: "Emphasising military-political cooperation, we can ensure that our officers are not only skilled in strategy but deeply committed to the ideals of the revolution. By aligning military education with Party principles, we will cultivate leaders who are both tactically proficient and ideologically loyal, ensuring the strength of our forces and the integrity of our cause."
 
 BLR_apolitical_army_doctrine: "Apolitical Army Doctrine"
 BLR_apolitical_army_doctrine_desc: "A Country's greatness weakness always lies in its politics; A Radicalised populace will use every tool at its disposal to overthrow the ruling regime, and that's why we are distancing our generals away from abiding by certain political doctrines. If people grow too close to Tukhachevsky, and he dies, then the state will collapse. Even Tukhachevsky knows that."
 
 BLR_soviet_war: "Down with the Corrupt Traitors of Moscow!"
 BLR_soviet_war_desc: "We must do whatever it takes to defeat the revisionist traitors of Moscow and proclaim the true Soviet Government with Tukhachevsky leading the revolution!"

 ### Events ###
 tukha.1.t: "The Polish Uprising Begins"
 tukha.1.d: "Men, arise to the struggle! Poland lives again, and it won't ever be curbstomped again! With the help of God and our guns, we will throw that bolshevik muscovite Mikhail Tukhachevsky back to Russia! Fight, and do not be afraid! We will win this fight for freedom as we have won many others. The Ukrainians and the Bermontians march against Tukhachevsky too, this will be an easy fight which we must endure! Poland, Arise!"
 tukha.1.a: "Jeszcze Polska nie zginęła!"
 
 tukha.2.t: "The Fight Begins"
 tukha.2.d: "The Polish bastards have declared an open rebellion against our rule, but worry not! We will destroy them on the field and make them submit to Marxism-Leninism once again!"
 tukha.2.a: "We will burn Warsaw all over again!"
 
 tukha.3.t: "We Have Failed."
 tukha.3.d: "We were not successful in defeating the Polish Resistance, and we have been reduced to a rump state in Belarus. At least we still control Minsk..."
 tukha.3.a: "Is this the end?"
 
 tukha.4.t: "Tukhachevsky Gave In"
 tukha.4.d: "Clearly seeing the situation on the battlefield, Mikhail Tukhachevsky has decided to give up and let us walk away with our independence without a real fight. The 10 day war which we fought against the regime hasn't seen that much consequences. Friends, it is time to heal and build! It is time to establish a truly great and independent Polish Republic!"
 tukha.4.a: "Poland has returned!"
 
 tukha.5.t: "The Question of Alignment"
 tukha.5.d: "The district needs to decide where its loyalties lie. We are the frontier of the Russian Revolution, but our marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky does indeed have his own ideas and ambitions. If we stay loyal to Moscow, we will inevitably end up annexed and our future will be in the Union. However, if we are loyal to the Red Napoleon, we can take the reins of the Revolution and reunite Russia as we wish."
 tukha.5.a: "We will take power!"
 tukha.5.b: "We must stay loyal to Moscow"
 
 tukha.6.t: "The Failed Land Reforms"
 tukha.6.d: "The mismanagement of the Russian Empire has left this land in an economic crisis of the likes never seen before. On top of that, the early mismanagement of our own administration has only worsened the situation as we failed to glue the problem. We must decide what to do. We can either embrace our current plan and hope it works out, or we can throw it out all together and adapt to the realities of Poland."
 tukha.6.a: "We must adapt"
 tukha.6.b: "We will finish what we started!"

 tukha.7.t: "The Polish Resistance"
 tukha.7.d: "After our victory at the Vistula, the Poles quickly formed a resilient movement which seeks to kick us out and re-establish an independent Polish state free of communism. These men, while brave, have done a major mistake. They underestimate the genius and power of our marshal Tukhachevsky. In this context, we have two choices. We can either attempt to win over their hearts or make their hearts bleed in order to get them to submit. What should we do?"
 tukha.7.a: "We must teach them!"
 tukha.7.b: "I sure do love mustard gas!"
 tukha.7.c: "Tukhachevsky must die!"
 
 tukha.8.t: "Mikhail Tukhachevsky Unites the Soviet Union"
 tukha.8.d: "News have come from the Kremlin that the Soviet Marshal has declared the old territories of the Russian Empire to be reunified under the control of the Soviet Union. This comes after the Red Army had dealt with the last pockets of the White Army in Siberia and defeated all warlords across the Russian Realm. Tukhachevsky's regime is often characterized as extremely brutal and often militaristic. Is there a future in which Russia is prosperous?"
 tukha.8.a: "The Red Napoleon"
 
 tukha.9.t: "The Issues at Hand"
 tukha.9.d: "At the moment, we face multiple issues in our quest to stabilize Poland. Firstly, the failed land reforms of the Russian Empire and our subsequent takeover did not work whatsoever. We need to find a solution for the land ownership problem in Poland. On top of that, a Resistance has formed which is loyal to Pilsudski and seeks to oust Tukhachevsky from power. And lastly but not least, we need to decide where our loyalties lie in the struggle to unify Russia."
 tukha.9.a: "Well, interesting."
 
 tukha.10.t: "A Call with the Boss"
 tukha.10.d: "Today, Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Vladimir Lenin talked on a call. Tukhachevsky explained the situation in Poland to Lenin, and he wasn't very excited to hear about all the problems the District is facing. Lenin promised support so long as Tukhachevsky goes along with the policies of the Communist Party. However, some people have started to question Tukhachevsky's loyalty to the Father of the Revolution..."
 tukha.10.a: "We will Serve the Revolution!"
 
 tukha.11.t: "The Awakening of Perun"
 tukha.11.d: "The Skies are talking to me. They know who I am. I am Mikhail Tukhachevsky. I am invincible. I am immortal. I am Perun. I must realize my true self. I must serve the Rod. The Slavic people will rise again."
 tukha.11.a: "§RSlava Rodu!§!"
 tukha.11.b: "§GI shouldn't end up like Ribbentrop...§!"
 
 tukha.12.t: "Approach in the Military Academy"
 tukha.12.d: "We need to choose whether we should indoctrinate our officers with true marxist-leninist ideals or if it is better to give them the autonomy of thought so they can establish new doctrines and theories which will help our cause in reunifing Russia."
 tukha.12.a: "Teach them the Revolution"
 tukha.12.b: "Autonomy of Thought"
 
 tukha.13.t: "The Method of Warfare"
 tukha.13.d: "There are two prominent schools of warfare within our ranks. One focuses on the mass assault of infantry and one focuses on establishing tank batallions in order to break stalemates and quickly and decisively win battles and minimize casualties whilst doing so. We need to choose which doctrine we should follow."
 tukha.13.a: "The Modern Approach"
 tukha.13.b: "Mass Assault"
 
 tukha.14.t: "Anarchists seize power in Minsk!"
 tukha.14.d: "The Anarchists led by Efim Yarchuk have successfully assassinated Tukhachevsky and taken control of the entire nation's administration and army."
 tukha.14.a: "§bAnarkhiya Mama Sinov Svoikh Lyubit!§!"
 
 tukha.15.t: "Mikhail Frunze escapes Central Asia and joins our Red Army!"
 tukha.15.d: "Mikhail Frunze along with the remnants of his Red Army and cadres in Central Asia have made the long trek all the way to our territories, seeking to integrate within Tukhachevsky's Soviet Army. Their expertise in fighting in the harsh deserts and flatlands of Central Asia will surely give us an edge in future combat in the region, along with Frunze joining the Red Army Officer Corps."
 tukha.15.a: "Excellent News!"
 
 tukha.16.t: "Capital City of the Directorate"
 tukha.16.b: "Now that we are in control of Moscow and we are gone of the old Bolshevik Cadres, where should we centralise the Red Army's governance and civillian administration from?"
 tukha.16.a: "I think we'll keep Minsk"
 tukha.16.b: "Moscow is the center of mainland Russia"
 tukha.16.c: "Petrograd is the historical capital"
 tukha.16.d: "Kiev would be interesting..." 
 
 ## Foreign Events ##
 BLR_ukr.1.t: "Ukraine Offers us Integration"
 BLR_ukr.1.d: "We can choose to peacefully integrate our army into the Ukrainian Soviet Republic which seems to be directing itself towards becoming a significant opposition to the slowly deteriorating regime in Moscow. We would partake in their military operations and help them achieve their goals for Ukraine and beyond. Brothers in arms?"
 BLR_ukr.1.a: "Never!"
 BLR_ukr.1.b: "Hold on, this might actually be a good idea... §R(this will end the game for you)§!"

 ## Polish Revolution ##
 BLR_tukhachevskys_regime_must_fall: "Tukhachevsky's Regime Must End!"
 BLR_tukhachevskys_regime_must_fall_desc: "Mikhail Tukhachevsky is a tyrant, no matter what day it is. But his power is faltering; Thousands of officers are beginning to doubt his control. The Polish resistance is coming up with newer more effective strategies, and the Russian Soviets are beginning their reunification operations once again. It is with one final push that we can get rid of this blight from the beautiful fields of Western Europe."
 
 BLR_smuggle_guns_through_silesia: "Smuggle Guns Through Silesia"
 BLR_smuggle_guns_through_silesia_desc: "One of the best allies to the resistance we can rely is on the Czechs, but our border with them is limited and mountainous, and thus we will begin conducting operations to smuggle guns from the central Bohemian headquarters through Silesia. If we claim it is to oppose Tukhachevsky in secret, people will likely turn the other cheek."
 
 BLR_sabotage_the_belarussian_industry: "Sabotage the Byelorussian Industry"
 BLR_sabotage_the_belarussian_industry_desc: "While not large, it is still a significant source for the Tukhachevskyist industry. Since the conquest of Poland, many of its resources have been stripped and transferred to Byelorussia, and its time to fight back against this. We will conduct raids on Railway lines, organise strikes & protests in factories and institutions, and produce a series of pamphlets and posters telling many Byelorussian men to stop supporting the Tukhachevskyist regime. We will begin with small efforts at first, to conserve our resources, then grow bigger with whichever method succeeds."
 
 BLR_throw_the_muscovites_out_now: "Send the Muscovites Back to Russia!"
 BLR_throw_the_muscovites_out_now_desc: "It is time for us to return the favour and to exile the red swines back from whence they came; to m*sc*w. They have not only ruined our state, executed intelligentsia & attempted to impose the cyrillic alphabet, but have also caused a crisis by enforcing the policy of sovietisation and russification. We have a number of minority enclaves in our territories that weren't there a decade before, and they are not going to return to where they came from if we do nothing about it."
 
 
 ## Tukhachevsky ##
 BLR_the_regime_of_the_red_napoleon: "The Regime of the Red Napoleon"
 BLR_the_regime_of_the_red_napoleon_desc: "We have suceeded in our plans. We have taken Poland for the Soviet Union. At the helm of this glorious, proletarian operation was the Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, also known as the Red Napoleon. Due to these events, the man has developed quite a reputation in the ranks of the Red Army. He has become known as the Red Napoleon. However, many criticize the Red Napoleon. By the Polish people, he is seen as a brutal leader and there is an active rebellion against our Soviet regime. We must destroy the rebels or we might face death in a land not very familiar to us."
 
 BLR_a_call_to_moscow: "A Call to Moscow"
 BLR_a_call_to_moscow_desc: "We must make a call to Moscow and talk with the leader of the revolution, Vladimir Lenin. We have to make a request for either resources or guns in order to be able to survive in the violatile situation we have found ourselves in when we crossed the Vistula. We should also talk about our orders for the future."
 
 BLR_observe_the_situation: "Observe the Local Situation"
 BLR_observe_the_situation_desc: "We barely won the war, and Pilsudski and his loyalists escaped to Silesia. Now we find ourselves in a strange land, filled with people who love dancing and are very resistant to our rule. We will have to make sure we are aware of the local traditions and terrain in order to be able to pacify the region."
 
 BLR_the_matters_of_the_district: "The Matters of the District"
 BLR_the_matters_of_the_district_desc: "We have multiple issues ahead of us. Firstly, the old failed land reforms of the Russian Empire and our own model have both failed miserably causing an economic crisis in Poland and Belarus. We will need to decide what to do with those. On top of that, the resistance is stronger than ever and we must decide how to approach it. At last, we also need to decide whether we are loyal to the Red Napoleon or to the Father of the Revolution Vladimir Lenin."

 BLR_the_cult_of_the_red_napoleon: "The Cult of the Red Napoleon"
 BLR_the_cult_of_the_red_napoleon_desc: "Mikhail Tukhachevsky, our glorious 'Red Napoleon', stands as the unyielding champion of Soviet Bolshevik ideals. A devoted servant of the Revolution, he has strengthened the foundations of our state built on unity, discipline, and an unwavering commitment to socialism. His vision extends beyond the battlefield- he seeks to modernize industry, solidify the Party’s control, and ensure that the revolution’s enemies are crushed before they can take root. Though traitors and counter-revolutionaries whisper in the shadows, the future belongs to those who embrace progress, and under Tukhachevsky’s leadership, we shall march ever forward!" 
 
 
 # Land Reform Branch #
 BLR_the_question_of_the_land_reforms: "The Question of the Land Reforms" 
 BLR_the_question_of_the_land_reforms_desc: "The New Economic Policy that Lenin proposed almost 2 years ago has not bore any fruit! Our local peasantry is not growing excess grain, only producing what they need and extra to gain some profit. As a result, we aren’t able to keep our workers fed and it is having a significant impact on our economy. Will we make changes to the current economic policy and the land reforms that have been destroying the [THIS.GetAdjective] economy, or will we continue on this path and reap the rewards we sow?.."
 
 BLR_to_finish_what_we_started: "To Finish What We Started..."
 BLR_to_finish_what_we_started_desc: "Tukhachevsky, deciding to disregard the advice from his advisors about the failing economy, has decided to continue the ‘NEP’ stating that it will take a combination of hard work and time for the land reforms to become fully realised and bear fruit."
 
 BLR_the_fruits_of_the_reforms: "The Fruits of the Reforms"
 BLR_the_fruits_of_the_reforms_desc: "After a long year of perserverance and commitment to the NEP, the results of our stubborness and hard work are beginning to show. The land reforms, once a source of instability and doubt in the socialist system, have taken root and provide a stronger foundation for agricultural and industrial growth far greater than we could have imagined. With the state guiding production and the people embracing their role in the collective struggle, prosperity is no longer a distant dream but an emerging reality."
 
 BLR_the_plan_was_a_mistake: "The Plan was a Mistake"
 BLR_the_plan_was_a_mistake_desc: "We have to put an end to these failed land reforms and this “New Economic Policy” before everything goes to shit! We will begin forcing collectivization efforts across our territories, giving our economy some breathing room to stabilise. Hopefully the land reforms haven’t done too much damage, we have a lot of industrialisation and urbanisation planned ahead of us if we want to spread our ideology abroad."
 
 BLR_accomodate_to_the_administrative_situation: "Accomodate to the Administrative Situation"
 BLR_accomodate_to_the_administrative_situation_desc: "The inefficiencies of our current administrative system have only worsened our economic struggles. To ensure the success of our industrial and collectivization efforts, we must reform our governance to better manage resources, production, and labor. By streamlining bureaucracy and improving coordination between local and central authorities, we can create a system that allows for economic growth and development. Only through decisive action now, can we lay the groundwork for a stable socialist economy."
 
 BLR_fight_the_post_war_corruption: "Fight Post-War Corruption"
 BLR_fight_the_post_war_corruption_desc: "While we may have saved the industrial situation, there are still many political saboteurs and corrupt officials that want nothing more than to stuff their pockets while spouting ideological verbatim. We will root these negative influences out of the administration and the economy, lest we do nothing and watch our system fester."
 
 
 # Resistance Branch #

 BLR_the_question_of_the_resistance_desc: "The Polish have been a major thorn in our side ever since we conquered Warsaw and drove Piłsudski out of his own land. While a good majority of the Polish peasantry and townsfolk have been very compliant towards our rather large military force… There is an almost equally large number of partisans that are haunting our patrols at night, smuggling rifles between cities and causing significant damage to our factories and infrastructure. This ‘Resistance’ must be put to a stop, either through displaying our brute military strength and hunting as many partisans as possible, or we can teach these rampant Poles the benefits of Communism…"
 
 BLR_teach_them_the_way_of_the_revolution: "Teach Them the Way of the Revolution"
 BLR_teach_them_the_way_of_the_revolution_desc: "Comrade Lenin’s teachings will be spread throughout the cities of Tukchaczewo, Łódź, Kraków and Poznań, utilizing handheld booklets and pamphlets. Gradually the partisans will be curious enough to learn about our wonderful ideology and see how much their lives can be improved by becoming Communist like us!"
 
 BLR_liberation_of_the_polish_workers: "Liberation of the Polish Workers"
 BLR_liberation_of_the_polish_workers_desc: "The workers of Poland struggle– For decades have they been manipulated and used with no regard for their safety or quality of life. No more!- Says Marshal Tukhachevsky, the liberation of the Polish workers has come, gone are the days of capitalistic exploitation and now they will learn to enjoy the fruits of their labour!"
 
 BLR_strike_fear_into_their_hearts: "Strike Fear Into Their Hearts"
 BLR_strike_fear_into_their_hearts_desc: "Enough is enough! Tukhachevsky is growing tired of these silly partisans fighting for their “independence”. Any Polish resident found with a weapon who isn’t also a member of the Bolshevik party will be executed for treason with no warning.

The Polish-Socialist Synthesis will reshape the Polish national identity through class struggle and unity against capitalism. Through educational reforms, labor policies, and cultural initiatives, we will instill in every worker a sense of revolutionary patriotism—one that binds Polish identity inseparably with the ideals of Bolshevism."

 BLR_where_do_our_loyalties_lie: "The Question of Loyalties"
 BLR_where_do_our_loyalties_lie_desc: "Our loyalty to the Union has been… questionable ever since Tukhachevsky created the Polish-Belarusian Military Administration and was given his own sphere of influence. On one hand, keeping true to Lenin and the administration in Moscow will strengthen the Bolshevik cause by integrating our armies and economies. Tukhachevsky has been having- strange dreams recently. Visions of a unified Soviet Union, with himself as the Grand Marshal."
 
 BLR_loyalty_to_the_red_napoleon: "Loyalty to the Red Napoleon"
 BLR_loyalty_to_the_red_napoleon_desc: "Tukhachevsky has always been there for the state, whether it has been economic problems, in simple battles or with the people, he is always seen helping and commanding. What do the folks at Moscow know? They do not share our struggles, nor do they have the same atrocious position as we do. Clearly, Mikhail Tukhachevsky will be the one, and ONLY one, that will guide us out of trouble."

 BLR_disconnect_from_the_union_desc: "The time has come for us to detach from the Soviet forces. We have our own mandate on our people now, it is time to secure control over what's ours and not allow any praemunire to go on. From now on and out, The Polish-Belarus military district will govern itself with no input from Moscow. This will definitely strain our relations between the Russians, but the Soviets are so 1921, we don't care anymore. Lenin is dying, and the Muscovite revolution is dying with him."
 
 BLR_loyalty_to_moscow: "Loyalty to Moscow"
 BLR_loyalty_to_moscow_desc: "Clearly, the logical choice in a situation such as ours is to join hands with the Muscovite soviets and embark on a brand new journey in the world revolution. With their help, the process will be much quicker and much more straightened out, and russifying the Poles will no longer be as much of an issue as it is currently."

 BLR_seek_soviet_economic_support_desc: "The Russian juggernaut brings forth one of the largest economies known to Europe. It is not unfair to assume that with our alliance to them we would get a share of the cut to serve as support and to uplift our own industry. After all, there can only be so many areas that resist our operation, and which limit our output. The Soviet support will definitely help eliminate this as a significant issue."

 BLR_strike_the_belarussian_kulaks_desc: "The Byelorussian Kulaks are one of the largest problems the country has ever experienced. These are powerful, rich landowners which can easily oppose our policies, and take a lot of support with them. It is time we stop this nonsense and nationalise their properties once and for all!

They are lacking this aim as of the minute, and thus it is time we look towards the direction of our farms to fund them and increase the amount of food we give to our soldiers. We will introduce a minor tax to help fund this measure, if it fails, we can always seize the lands of rich landlords again, no biggie!"

 BLR_utilize_the_polish_workrforce_desc: "The Polish lands harbour some of the largest working-age populations in Eastern Europe. It is a shame to keep covering over such a gold mine. And thus we will begin a new Polish-langauge programme where we try to recruit as many polish workers as we can, to not only work on the state, but also build up strategically important infrastructure in Poland. If they work in their home country, they have no reason to oppose this as much as if they worked on Belarus. And besides, many Polish people are unemployed, so this programme would definitely see a guaranteed level of success."

We must teach the 'correct' version of communism to both our youth and our aspirers.
