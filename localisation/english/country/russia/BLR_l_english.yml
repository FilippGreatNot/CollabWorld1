 ## Leader Descriptions ##
 POLITICS_TUKHACHEVSKY_DESC: "Mikhail Tukhachevsky, born into an atheistic aristocrat family, has become the Hero of the Russian Revolution. His military prowess in defending the Revolution gained him the nickname of the Red Napoleon. While many of his operations did fail due to the corruption of the party and the disloyalty of the officers, he was able to, against all odds, defeat Marshal Pilsudski and reveal his true potential to the world. This is what got him his nickname. Now, he faces a unique challenge: ruling over a country." 
 POLITICS_TUKHACHEVSKY_PAGAN_DESC: "Mikhail "Perun" Tukhachevsky- the Red Napoleon, the Red Alexander. As a young boy, Mikhail was never afraid of thunder- he would look out of his window during a thunderstorm and admire how the lightning bolts struck down the trees from across the lake, the colossal noise thundering, shaking the foundations of his family home. The memories of the immense power that those bright bolts of energy had, stuck with him ever since. Mikhail found his idol, found his deity, he discovered the only God worth worshipping in this cold and harsh world. Slava Perun!"

 ### Events ###
 tukha.1.t: "The Polish Uprising Begins"
 tukha.1.d: "Men, arise to the struggle! Poland lives again, and it won't ever be curbstomped again! With the help of God and our guns, we will throw that bolshevik muscovite Mikhail Tukhachevsky back to Russia! Fight, and do not be afraid! We will win this fight for freedom as we have won many others. The Ukrainians and the Bermontians march against Tukhachevsky too, this will be an easy fight which we must endure! Poland, Arise!"
 tukha.1.a: "Jeszcze Polska nie zginęła!"
 
 tukha.2.t: "The Fight Begins"
 tukha.2.d: "The Polish bastards have declared an open rebellion against our rule, but worry not! We will destroy them on the field and make them submit to Marxism-Leninism once again!"
 tukha.2.a: "We will burn Warsaw all over again!"
 
 tukha.3.t: "We Have Failed."
 tukha.3.d: "We were not successful in defeating the Polish Resistance, and we have been reduced to a rump state in Belarus. At least we still control Minsk..."
 tukha.3.a: "Is this the end?"
 
 tukha.4.t: "Tukhachevsky Gave In"
 tukha.4.d: "Clearly seeing the situation on the battlefield, Mikhail Tukhachevsky has decided to give up and let us walk away with our independence without a real fight. The 10 day war which we fought against the regime hasn't seen that much consequences. Friends, it is time to heal and build! It is time to establish a truly great and independent Polish Republic!"
 tukha.4.a: "Poland has returned!"
 
 tukha.5.t: "The Question of Alignment"
 tukha.5.d: "The district needs to decide where its loyalties lie. We are the frontier of the Russian Revolution, but our marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky does indeed have his own ideas and ambitions. If we stay loyal to Moscow, we will inevitably end up annexed and our future will be in the Union. However, if we are loyal to the Red Napoleon, we can take the reins of the Revolution and reunite Russia as we wish."
 tukha.5.a: "We will take power!"
 tukha.5.b: "We must stay loyal to Moscow"
 
 tukha.6.t: "The Failed Land Reforms"
 tukha.6.d: "The mismanagement of the Russian Empire has left this land in an economic crisis of the likes never seen before. On top of that, the early mismanagement of our own administration has only worsened the situation as we failed to glue the problem. We must decide what to do. We can either embrace our current plan and hope it works out, or we can throw it out all together and adapt to the realities of Poland."
 tukha.6.a: "We must adapt"
 tukha.6.b: "We will finish what we started!"

 tukha.7.t: "The Polish Resistance"
 tukha.7.d: "After our victory at the Vistula, the Poles quickly formed a resilient movement which seeks to kick us out and re-establish an independent Polish state free of communism. These men, while brave, have done a major mistake. They underestimate the genius and power of our marshal Tukhachevsky. In this context, we have two choices. We can either attempt to win over their hearts or make their hearts bleed in order to get them to submit. What should we do?"
 tukha.7.a: "We must teach them!"
 tukha.7.b: "I sure do love mustard gas!"
 tukha.7.c: "Tukhachevsky must die!"
 
 tukha.8.t: "Mikhail Tukhachevsky Unites the Soviet Union"
 tukha.8.d: "News have come from the Kremlin that the Soviet Marshal has declared the old territories of the Russian Empire to be reunified under the control of the Soviet Union. This comes after the Red Army had dealt with the last pockets of the White Army in Siberia and defeated all warlords across the Russian Realm. Tukhachevsky's regime is often characterized as extremely brutal and often militaristic. Is there a future in which Russia is prosperous?"
 tukha.8.a: "The Red Napoleon"
 
 tukha.9.t: "The Issues at Hand"
 tukha.9.d: "At the moment, we face multiple issues in our quest to stabilize Poland. Firstly, the failed land reforms of the Russian Empire and our subsequent takeover did not work whatsoever. We need to find a solution for the land ownership problem in Poland. On top of that, a Resistance has formed which is loyal to Pilsudski and seeks to oust Tukhachevsky from power. And lastly but not least, we need to decide where our loyalties lie in the struggle to unify Russia."
 tukha.9.a: "Well, interesting."
 
 tukha.10.t: "A Call with the Boss"
 tukha.10.d: "Today, Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Vladimir Lenin talked on a call. Tukhachevsky explained the situation in Poland to Lenin, and he wasn't very excited to hear about all the problems the District is facing. Lenin promised support so long as Tukhachevsky goes along with the policies of the Communist Party. However, some people have started to question Tukhachevsky's loyalty to the Father of the Revolution..."
 tukha.10.a: "We will Serve the Revolution!"
 
 tukha.11.t: "The Awakening of Perun"
 tukha.11.d: "The Skies are talking to me. They know who I am. I am Perun. I am invincible. I am immortal. I am Mikhail Tukhachevsky. I must realize my true self. I must serve the Rod. Russia will rise again."
 tukha.11.a: "§RSlava Rodu!§!"
 tukha.11.b: "§GI shouldn't end up like Ribbentrop...§!"
 
 tukha.12.t: "Approach in the Military Academy"
 tukha.12.d: "We need to choose whether we should indoctrinate our officers with true marxist-leninist ideals or if it is better to give them the autonomy of thought so they can establish new doctrines and theories which will help our cause in reunifing Russia."
 tukha.12.a: "Teach them the Revolution"
 tukha.12.b: "Autonomy of Thought"
 
 tukha.13.t: "The Method of Warfare"
 tukha.13.d: "There are two prominent schools of warfare within our ranks. One focuses on the mass assault of infantry and one focuses on establishing tank batallions in order to break stalemates and quickly and decisively win battles and minimize casualties whilst doing so. We need to choose which doctrine we should follow."

 tukha.13.b: "Mass Assault"
 
 tukha.14.t: "Anarchists seize power in Minsk!"
 tukha.14.d: "The Anarchists led by Efim Yarchuk have successfully assassinated Tukhachevsky and taken control of the entire nation's administration and army."
 tukha.14.a: "§bAnarkhiya Mama Sinov Svoikh Lyubit!§!"
 
 ## Foreign Events ##
 BLR_ukr.1.t: "Ukraine Offers us Integration"
 BLR_ukr.1.d: "We can choose to peacefully integrate our army into the Ukrainian Soviet Republic which seems to be directing itself towards becoming a significant opposition to the slowly deteriorating regime in Moscow. We would partake in their military operations and help them achieve their goals for Ukraine and beyond. Brothers in arms?"
 BLR_ukr.1.a: "Never!"
 BLR_ukr.1.b: "Hold on, this might actually be a good idea... §R(this will end the game for you)§!"

At the helm of this glorious, proletarian operation was the Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, also known as the Red Napoleon. Due to these events, the man has developed quite a reputation in the ranks of the Red Army. He has become known as the Red Napoleon. However, many criticize the Red Napoleon. By the Polish people, he is seen as a brutal leader and there is an active rebellion against our Soviet regime. We must destroy the rebels or we might face death in a land not very familiar to us."

We will have to make sure we are aware of the local traditions and terrain in order to be able to pacify the region."

 BLR_the_matters_of_the_district_desc: "We have multiple issues ahead of us. Firstly, the old failed land reforms of the Russian Empire and our own model have both failed miserably causing an economic crisis in Poland and Belarus. We will need to decide what to do with those. On top of that, the resistance is stronger than ever and we must decide how to approach it.

His vision extends beyond the battlefield- he seeks to modernize industry, solidify the Party’s control, and ensure that the revolution’s enemies are crushed before they can take root. Though traitors and counter-revolutionaries whisper in the shadows, the future belongs to those who embrace progress, and under Tukhachevsky’s leadership, we shall march ever forward!"

 BLR_the_question_of_the_land_reforms_desc: "The New Economic Policy that Lenin proposed almost 2 years ago has not bore any fruit! Our local peasantry is not growing excess grain, only producing what they need and extra to gain some profit. As a result, we aren’t able to keep our workers fed and it is having a significant impact on our economy. Will we make changes to the current economic policy and the land reforms that have been destroying the [THIS.GetAdjective] economy, or will we continue on this path and reap the rewards we sow?.."

 BLR_the_fruits_of_the_reforms_desc: "After a long year of perserverance and commitment to the NEP, the results of our stubborness and hard work are beginning to show. The land reforms, once a source of instability and doubt in the socialist system, have taken root and provide a stronger foundation for agricultural and industrial growth far greater than we could have imagined. With the state guiding production and the people embracing their role in the collective struggle, prosperity is no longer a distant dream but an emerging reality."
 
 BLR_the_plan_was_a_mistake: "The Plan was a Mistake"
 BLR_the_plan_was_a_mistake_desc: "We have to put an end to these failed land reforms and this “New Economic Policy” before everything goes to shit! We will begin forcing collectivization efforts across our territories, giving our economy some breathing room to stabilise. Hopefully the land reforms haven’t done too much damage, we have a lot of industrialisation and urbanisation planned ahead of us if we want to spread our ideology abroad."
 
 BLR_accomodate_to_the_administrative_situation: "Accomodate to the Administrative Situation"
 BLR_accomodate_to_the_administrative_situation_desc: "The inefficiencies of our current administrative system have only worsened our economic struggles. To ensure the success of our industrial and collectivization efforts, we must reform our governance to better manage resources, production, and labor. By streamlining bureaucracy and improving coordination between local and central authorities, we can create a system that allows for economic growth and development. Only through decisive action now, can we lay the groundwork for a stable socialist economy."

 BLR_fight_the_post_war_corruption_desc: "While we may have saved the industrial situation, there are still many political saboteurs and corrupt officials that want nothing more than to stuff their pockets while spouting ideological verbatim.

 BLR_the_question_of_the_resistance_desc: "The Polish have been a major thorn in our side ever since we conquered Warsaw and drove Piłsudski out of his own land. While a good majority of the Polish peasantry and townsfolk have been very compliant towards our rather large military force… There is an almost equally large number of partisans that are haunting our patrols at night, smuggling rifles between cities and causing significant damage to our factories and infrastructure. This ‘Resistance’ must be put to a stop, either through displaying our brute military strength and hunting as many partisans as possible, or we can teach these rampant Poles the benefits of Communism…"

 BLR_teach_them_the_way_of_the_revolution_desc: "Comrade Lenin’s teachings will be spread throughout the cities of Tukchaczewo, Łódź, Kraków and Poznań, utilizing handheld booklets and pamphlets.

 BLR_strike_fear_into_their_hearts_desc: "Enough is enough! Tukhachevsky is growing tired of these silly partisans fighting for their “independence”.

We will show these “freedom fighters” the might of the Red Army."

The Polish-Socialist Synthesis will reshape the Polish national identity through class struggle and unity against capitalism. Through educational reforms, labor policies, and cultural initiatives, we will instill in every worker a sense of revolutionary patriotism—one that binds Polish identity inseparably with the ideals of Bolshevism."

On one hand, keeping true to Lenin and the administration in Moscow will strengthen the Bolshevik cause by integrating our armies and economies. Tukhachevsky has been having- strange dreams recently.

 BLR_promote_a_healthy_soldier_lifestyle_desc: "The Red Army’s soldiers are proud, courageous men, they are willing to die in defense of our glorious state. The only thing capable of destroying our organisation and our soldier’s confidence in the Red Army is disease and starvation. We will increase funding of our medical cooperatives, seeking antiviral and antibacterial methods to eliminate weakness in our Army."
 
 BLR_the_method_of_warfare: "The Method of Warfare"
 BLR_the_method_of_warfare_desc: "We are stuck at a crossroads along our path to fully realising the strength of Deep Operations. We must decide on whether we take a modern approach and increase our research, development and production of armored behemoths and flying steel beasts. Or... to focus on the 'Cult of Offensive', sending waves after waves of human meat shields at our enemy until they attrition and ultimately run out of bullets."
 
 BLR_a_modern_approach: "A Modern Approach"
 BLR_a_modern_approach_desc: "Tukhachevsky has decided to pursue an armored, mechanised and bomber-heavy doctrine that will win us battles on land and air. The Red Army will eventually be capable of inflicting heavy enemy casualties through the heavy bombing of their frontlines and homefront, while mass offensives sow chaos and disorganisation in enemy ranks. This instability can be exploited by breaking through the gaps made in the enemy's lines and reinforcing our flanks, rendering the enemy's frontline obsolete."

The [BLR tag-name] is laying the foundations of a modern industrial base, dedicating resources to the production of new military equipment. With fresh designs for armored vehicles and aircraft, we shall secure our place as a rising power and ensure the strength of our armed forces in the face of any challenge!"

 BLR_mass_assault_tactics_desc: "Tukhachevsky has come to the very thoughtful realisation that researching and producing armored and mechanised vehicles is a very expensive process that will require a lot of time that we do not possess–therefore, he has decreed that every man, woman and child start basic training with infantry equipment so that they may bare arms if our enemies are to encroach our lands."
 
 BLR_sacrifice_for_the_revolution: "Sacrifice for the Revolution"
 BLR_sacrifice_for_the_revolution_desc: "Our army is in desperate need of fresh recruits! Given our plans to wage war, the casualties we are likely to endure will be unsustainable unless we act swiftly. By expanding recruitment efforts and enforcing conscription, we will ensure that more young men are drawn into our ranks, strengthening our military machine and securing our survival!"

 BLR_utilize_the_weapons_of_the_old_front_desc: "The Imperial Russian Army has left warehouses and stockpiles of infantry guns and munitions after their failure at defeating the Germans and the subsequent revolution in Petrograd and Moscow. We believe that these rifles will be put to better use in our revitalised Red Army!" 
 
 BLR_the_deep_warfare_theory: "The Deep Battle Theory"
 BLR_the_deep_warfare_theory_desc: "We have done it! Tukhachevsky has completed his theory of Deep Operations, providing our officer corps with the knowledge to reshape the way we fight. By utilizing shock tactics and breakthroughs to disrupt our enemy’s organization, we will penetrate their defenses and exploit their vulnerabilities. Our brave pilots will rain destruction upon their positions, while our artillery sweeps the battlefield. With our renewed military doctrine, victory is assured—now and forever! Ura!"
