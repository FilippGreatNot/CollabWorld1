 arm.1.t: "Armenian Elections"
 arm.1.d: "After preparing all the neccesary ballots and institutions for this election, it has finally come and will decide the future of the Armenian Nation. Firstly, we could elect the Dashnaktsutyun who are leading our country currently. We could also turn to the Social Democrat Hunchakians. If we don't like either of those options, Tseghakron is the nationalist option."
 arm.1.a: "Dashnaktsutyun"
 arm.1.b: "Social Democrat Hunchakians"
 arm.1.c: "Tseghakron"
 arm.1.e: "Prevent the election!"
 arm.2.t: "Tseghakron Wins Armenian Elections"
 arm.2.d: "Fresh news are coming out of Armenia that the nationalist and revanchist Tseghakron party took charge of Armenia in the general election. This marks an end of 4 years of Dashnaktsutyun rule and a new chapter in Armenia's new history. The nation which faced a genocide a few years prior is now on the way to get its revenge..."
 arm.2.a: "For Armenia!"
 arm.3.t: "Social Democrat Hunchaks win Armenian Election"
 arm.3.d: "The Armenian Election has resulted in a victory for the hunchakians. This marks a big change for Armenia as 4 years of Dashnaktsutyun rule have come to an abrupt end and now a new government is being formed to change the nation. What is being expected is a focus on welfare, health and other things. The party seeks to build a new future for Armenia"
 arm.3.a: "Interesting"
 arm.4.t: "Dashnaktsutyun Retain Power in Armenia"
 arm.4.d: "The Armenian General Elections have resulted in the Dashnaktsutyun party retaining power for another 4 years. This comes as a surprise because the curfew put in place a few months back severely impacted the party's popularity. However, now, the party has bounced back. It is also very probable that there will still be a change of leadership, especially in the presidency. Let's see what happens."
 arm.4.a: "Another 4 Years"
 arm.5.t: "Coalition Collapse in Armenia"
 arm.5.d: "The Armenian government has been thrown into turmoil following a shocking announcement by Arsham Khondkaryan, the influential Head of the Armenian Organization of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. The fragile coalition between Dashnaktsutyun, the leading political force, and the Socialist-Revolutionaries has come to an abrupt end. Khondkaryan declared the dissolution of the coalition, citing irreconcilable differences over economic policy and national strategy. This sudden move leaves the ruling Dashnaktsutyun scrambling to maintain control and stability amidst fears of political fragmentation and public discontent. The collapse of this partnership marks a critical turning point for Armenia. As new alliances are sought and rival factions plot their next moves, the fate of the country hangs in the balance. Will this lead to renewed strength and unity, or a descent into chaos?"
 arm.5.a: "Let the Socialists face the consequences of their actions"
 arm.6.t: "The Principles of Tseghakronism"
 arm.6.d: "The term Tsehakronism  is something greater than patriotism or the veneration of one's ancestors, encompassing these and similar concepts. This is reflected in Garegin Nzhdeh's choice of a new term as the name for his ideological concept. The ideology of  Tsehakronism  divides Armenians into three emotionally-conscious parts: 1. The national (tsekh), 2. The wavering or undecided (jokhovurd), 3. The Anti-National (Takank)."
 arm.6.a: "By the Principles of Tseghakronism, we will endure!"
 arm.7.t: "Offer for Armenian Reunification"
 arm.7.d: "The government in Yerevan has offered us to join the Armenian State and establish a true strong Armenia with large borders which have no bounds. We can either accept this offer, or reject and potentially face backlash or even war if their government is brave enough. However, why would we reject this offer? Us Armenians are brothers after all!"
 arm.7.a: "We preffer autonomy"
 arm.7.b: "Armenian Unity Achieved!"

 ### Focuses ##
 focus_arm_verqer: "Wounds of Armenia"
 focus_arm_verqer_desc: "Armenia as A nation has suffered wounds deeper than most, but that is nothing compared to the Armenian People. The Reds, Georgians, Turks, enemies surround our nation from nearly every angle. We fight battle after battle to ensure that Armenia will not become a factoid in the history books, this has left us in a state of stagnant near anarchy. But now, now is the time to lick our wounds. Thousands of Armenian Refugees have overwhelmed our infrastructure in our west, and The American Red Cross ran refugee camps are now overstaying their welcome with a influenza outbreak affecting the camps and the surrounding region. We are faced with implementing a curfew to help contain the spread of the outbreak. This should be our first step to restoring order in our country."
 focus_arm_boycott_elections: "Prevent the election of 1922"
 focus_arm_instability: "Instability"
 focus_arm_instability_desc: "Our curfews have resulted in the Refugee population becoming unruly, what had started as a small protest against facial coverings has devolved into full scale rioting. Notably, the largest camp has been all but destroyed and some report the Refugees have begun looting in the countryside. This has caused total chaos within the government as vicious debate and bureaucracy has slowed any response to the continual breakdown of our society. Police action is ineffective and Azerbaijani Socialist partisans have increased activity in our east. We are surrounded by vultures, we mustn't let them pick our state apart! "
 focus_arm_dashnak_split: "Intraparty split"
 focus_arm_dashnak_split_desc: "The ARF at its core has always been a federation of various political groups, from broad socialists, hardline nationalists, liberals, and agrarians. This uneasy union of ideologies has lasted since 1890, but the pressures exerted upon it from our current struggles is straining, members are leaving, political momentum has ceased to exist as The Dashnaktsutyun splinters into several camps. We have enough external threats, must we really have internal ones?"
 focus_arm_dashnak_chekists: "Intraparty chekists"
 focus_arm_dashnak_chekists_desc: "The smell of conspiracy reeks within Yerevan. Chekists, Red Russian agents who have infiltrated every level of our state, from government to the Army. Tensions have grown even higher with internal intelligence reports finding these agents behind the recent unrest in our west. As it seems, the line between external internal threats is all but blurred. Just last Sunday, a Chekist affiliated officer attempted to smuggle arms out of Yerevan's Armory. Even now, Armenia's enemies scheme within our very own borders, the call is coming from inside the house."
 focus_arm_dashnak_end: "The end of Dashnaktsutyun?"
 focus_arm_dashnak_end_desc: "Trust in the political union has all but dissolved in the last few months. Chekists run wild, Refugees riot, and even within the party we are not unified. Our international bureaus are beginning to cut contact with Yerevan. Several key officials within the party have already cut connections, we are left with just our ideological core which was not strong to begin with. This may spell the end of Dashnaktsutyun as we know it."
 focus_arm_four_years: "Summing up four years of rule"
 focus_arm_four_years_desc: "It's been one hell of a ride. Dashnaktsutyun’s time in the sun just might be fading into the sunset, but our four years in power might provide some insight into Armenia's future. War, famine, disease, yes we’ve had our fair share of trouble as a nation, but we’ve also had triumphs. Armenia has shown in just a handful of years that it will not go quietly into the night, and that may just continue, even without the guiding hand of The Dashnaktsutyun."
 focus_arm_grand_elections: "General elections of 1922"
 focus_arm_grand_elections_desc: "In the face of political paralysis and national uncertainty, the call for general elections offers a democratic solution to our deepening crisis. Through the ballot box, the Armenian people will choose the course our nation must take whether to restore stability, pursue reform, or embrace a new vision for the future. This pivotal moment will shape the destiny of Armenia for generations to come"
 focus_arm_hnchak: "Social Democrat Hunchakian Party"
 focus_arm_dashnak_new: "Dashnaktsutyun"
 focus_arm_dashnak_new_desc: "Dashnaktsutyun is the oldest political party in Armenia, uniting individuals from a wide spectrum of ideologies under one banner. In these halls gather nationalists, socialists, and pragmatists alike bound not by uniformity, but by a shared commitment to the Armenian nation. Harnessing this diversity may prove challenging, but it also offers a unique strength in shaping Armenia’s future."

 focus_arm_tseghn_u_takank: "Tseghn u takankn"
 focus_arm_revive: "Revival of national spirit"
 focus_arm_revive_desc: "We must focus on rebuilding a true national spirit which promotes unity, nationalism and pride of all Armenians for their ancient homeland. The Turks, the Russians and the Persians have tried countless times to steal our national identity and to assimilate us into their arrogant foreign empires. Yet we have persisted, and Armenia's national pride won't fall like that of our turkified neighbors. Armenia is pure, proud and strong!"

 focus_arm_avetis_aharonian: "Avetis Aharonian"
 focus_arm_avetis_aharonian_desc: "Throughout the existence of the Republic of Armenia, four different Prime Ministers - all from the Dashnaktsutyun - have governed, each pursuing a distinct political course. The collapse of the governing coalition under Simon Vratsian has left the country in need of stability and unity. In this time of uncertainty, Avetis Aharonian - former Chairman of the Armenian National Council and of the Parliament - emerges as a respected figure capable of bridging internal divisions and guiding the nation forward."
 focus_arm_dashnak_reforming: "Reform Dashnaktsutyun"
 focus_arm_dashnak_reforming_desc: "Reforming the Dashnaktsutyun is not merely an internal party matter - it is a national imperative. The fate of the party is deeply intertwined with the future of the Armenian state. By renewing our ranks, modernizing our principles, and addressing internal contradictions, we lay the foundation for a more stable and effective government. Only through reform can both the party and the Republic endure the trials that lie ahead."
 focus_arm_dashnak_cleaning: "Cleanse Dashnaktsutyun's ranks"
 focus_arm_dashnak_cleaning_desc: "The Dashnaktsutyun and the government have long been compromised by Chekist agents and infiltrators - planted with the sole aim of undermining our state and dismantling our national movement from within. This is no mere security concern; it is a foundational threat to the survival of the Republic. The time has come to root out these traitors, expose their networks, and deliver justice. We will cleanse the party and restore its integrity, no matter the cost."
 focus_arm_dashnak_reputation: "Restore Dashnaktsutyun's reputation"
 focus_arm_dashnak_reputation_desc: "Dashnaktsutyun - meaning "union" or "federation" - is the oldest political party in Armenia, a symbol of national struggle and perseverance. Once the vanguard of Armenian independence, its reputation has suffered through years of turmoil and war. Now, in this time of national crisis, we must rebuild the people’s trust and restore Dashnaktsutyun as a unifying force for the Armenian state."
 focus_arm_diaspora: "Appeal to the diaspora"
 focus_arm_diaspora_desc: "The Armenian diaspora, scattered across the world by genocide and exile, remains a vital part of our national identity. Now more than ever, we must call upon them to return to their ancestral homeland or to support it from afar. Their expertise, resources, and unwavering spirit can bolster our economy, strengthen our institutions, and heal the wounds of the past. Reconnecting with the diaspora is not only a matter of survival, it is a step toward national revival."
 focus_arm_nor_dashnak: "New dashnaktsakan"
 focus_arm_nor_dashnak_desc: "The time has come to define a new ideal within the Dashnaktsutyun - a figure who embodies unwavering loyalty to the homeland, the state, the people, and the land itself. The New Dashnaktsakan must stand as a living symbol of unity, discipline, and national purpose. In an era of division and uncertainty, this new generation of party members will serve not personal ambition, but the sacred mission of national rebirth."
 focus_arm_dashnak_bureau: "Dashnaktsutyun's bureau system"
 focus_arm_dashnak_bureau_desc: "The internal bureau system of the Dashnaktsutyun has long governed the party’s structure and decision-making. However, in the face of crisis and internal fragmentation, it is time to reassess its effectiveness. We must conduct a thorough review, identify its flaws, and implement the necessary reforms to ensure a more transparent, accountable, and unified leadership. Only through introspection can the party evolve and meet the challenges of a new era."
 focus_arm_mshak_banvor: "Mshak Banvor"
 focus_arm_mshak_banvor_desc: ""Mshag panvor, rrenchber  akhber, Arik mianank, arrach knank, Ashkhadanki tadin bashdban, Dashnagtsoutyan tew, tigounk dank..." " Toiler, laborer, brother in the field, Come, let us unite and march forward. Defenders of the cause of labor,Let us give our strength to the Dashnaktsutyun" - these are not just the opening lines of an anthem of ARF, but a call to unity, to struggle, and to justice. The Dashnaktsutyun anthem speaks to the soul of the worker, the soldier, and the patriot. In these powerful verses lies the foundation of a new political consciousness - one rooted in sacrifice, dignity, and collective strength. As we shape a new generation of leaders and citizens, let these words guide us. Through their spirit, we will forge a Dashnaktsutyun reborn."
 focus_arm_coalit_gov: "Coalition government"
 focus_arm_coalit_gov_desc: "Like it or not, coalition-building has always been a cornerstone of governance in the Republic of Armenia. From alliances with the Armenian Populist Party to cooperation with the Socialist Revolutionaries, our governments have relied on unity to survive. Now, in these uncertain times, we must once again extend our hand this time to the Tseghakron movement. Though ideological differences remain, a shared vision for Armenia’s strength and sovereignty may be the key to consolidating power and securing the nation’s future."

 focus_arm_nor_hasarakutyun: "New society"
 focus_arm_nor_hasarakutyun_desc: "In the aftermath of the genocide, Armenia was left not only in ruins, but intellectually crippled. Our thinkers, cultural figures, public leaders, and political minds were murdered or driven into silence - exterminated not only in Ottoman Turkey but also in the Russian Empire. This was a deliberate attempt to erase the very soul of our nation. But we will not remain in silence. We must rise again and become the true successors of those who were lost. Through education, culture, and civic revival, we shall rebuild a new Armenian society - one rooted in knowledge, dignity, and leadership. We must become a nation of intelligentsia."
 focus_arm_united_society: "United armenian society"
 focus_arm_united_society_desc: "This is our ultimate goal: a united Armenian society. All past grievances and divisions must be left behind. It matters not whether you are a Dashnaktsakan, a Hnchakian, or a Ramkavar political affiliations no longer hold the weight they once did. What matters now is the strength of our collective will and the power of a united mind. The time has come for us to rise above our differences and embrace a unified vision for Armenia’s future."

We will protect them, nurture them, and do everything in our power to ensure their future. They are our hope, our strength, and our future.
