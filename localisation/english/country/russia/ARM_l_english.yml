 arm.1.t: "Armenian Elections"
 arm.1.d: "After preparing all the neccesary ballots and institutions for this election, it has finally come and will decide the future of the Armenian Nation. Firstly, we could elect the Dashnaktsutyun who are leading our country currently. We could also turn to the Social Democrat Hunchakians. If we don't like either of those options, Tseghakron is the nationalist option."
 arm.1.a: "Dashnaktsutyun"
 arm.1.b: "Social Democrat Hunchakians"
 arm.1.c: "Tseghakron"
 arm.1.e: "Prevent the election!"
 arm.2.t: "Tseghakron Wins Armenian Elections"
 arm.2.d: "Fresh news are coming out of Armenia that the nationalist and revanchist Tseghakron party took charge of Armenia in the general election. This marks an end of 4 years of Dashnaktsutyun rule and a new chapter in Armenia's new history. The nation which faced a genocide a few years prior is now on the way to get its revenge..."
 arm.2.a: "For Armenia!"
 arm.3.t: "Social Democrat Hunchaks win Armenian Election"
 arm.3.d: "The Armenian Election has resulted in a victory for the hunchakians. This marks a big change for Armenia as 4 years of Dashnaktsutyun rule have come to an abrupt end and now a new government is being formed to change the nation. What is being expected is a focus on welfare, health and other things. The party seeks to build a new future for Armenia"
 arm.3.a: "Interesting"
 arm.4.t: "Dashnaktsutyun Retain Power in Armenia"
 arm.4.d: "The Armenian General Elections have resulted in the Dashnaktsutyun party retaining power for another 4 years. This comes as a surprise because the curfew put in place a few months back severely impacted the party's popularity. However, now, the party has bounced back. It is also very probable that there will still be a change of leadership, especially in the presidency. Let's see what happens."
 arm.4.a: "Another 4 Years"
 arm.5.t: "Coalition Collapse in Armenia"
 arm.5.d: "The Armenian government has been thrown into turmoil following a shocking announcement by Arsham Khondkaryan, the influential Head of the Armenian Organization of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. The fragile coalition between Dashnaktsutyun, the leading political force, and the Socialist-Revolutionaries has come to an abrupt end. Khondkaryan declared the dissolution of the coalition, citing irreconcilable differences over economic policy and national strategy. This sudden move leaves the ruling Dashnaktsutyun scrambling to maintain control and stability amidst fears of political fragmentation and public discontent. The collapse of this partnership marks a critical turning point for Armenia. As new alliances are sought and rival factions plot their next moves, the fate of the country hangs in the balance. Will this lead to renewed strength and unity, or a descent into chaos?"
 arm.5.a: "Let the Socialists face the consequences of their actions"
 arm.6.t: "The Principles of Tseghakronism"
 arm.6.d: "The term Tsehakronism  is something greater than patriotism or the veneration of one's ancestors, encompassing these and similar concepts. This is reflected in Garegin Nzhdeh's choice of a new term as the name for his ideological concept. The ideology of  Tsehakronism  divides Armenians into three emotionally-conscious parts: 1. The national (tsekh), 2. The wavering or undecided (jokhovurd), 3. The Anti-National (Takank)."
 arm.6.a: "By the Principles of Tseghakronism, we will endure!"
 arm.7.t: "Offer for Armenian Reunification"
 arm.7.d: "The government in Yerevan has offered us to join the Armenian State and establish a true strong Armenia with large borders which have no bounds. We can either accept this offer, or reject and potentially face backlash or even war if their government is brave enough. However, why would we reject this offer? Us Armenians are brothers after all!"
 arm.7.a: "We preffer autonomy"
 arm.7.b: "Armenian Unity Achieved!"

 ### Focuses ##
 focus_arm_verqer: "Wounds of Armenia"
 focus_arm_verqer_desc: "Armenia as A nation has suffered wounds deeper than most, but that is nothing compared to the Armenian People. The Reds, Georgians, Turks, enemies surround our nation from nearly every angle. We fight battle after battle to ensure that Armenia will not become a factoid in the history books, this has left us in a state of stagnant near anarchy. But now, now is the time to lick our wounds. Thousands of Armenian Refugees have overwhelmed our infrastructure in our west, and The American Red Cross ran refugee camps are now overstaying their welcome with a influenza outbreak affecting the camps and the surrounding region. We are faced with implementing a curfew to help contain the spread of the outbreak. This should be our first step to restoring order in our country."
 focus_arm_boycott_elections: "Prevent the election of 1922"
 focus_arm_instability: "Instability"
 focus_arm_instability_desc: "Our curfews have resulted in the Refugee population becoming unruly, what had started as a small protest against facial coverings has devolved into full scale rioting. Notably, the largest camp has been all but destroyed and some report the Refugees have begun looting in the countryside. This has caused total chaos within the government as vicious debate and bureaucracy has slowed any response to the continual breakdown of our society. Police action is ineffective and Azerbaijani Socialist partisans have increased activity in our east. We are surrounded by vultures, we mustn't let them pick our state apart! "
 focus_arm_dashnak_split: "Intraparty split"
 focus_arm_dashnak_split_desc: "The ARF at its core has always been a federation of various political groups, from broad socialists, hardline nationalists, liberals, and agrarians. This uneasy union of ideologies has lasted since 1890, but the pressures exerted upon it from our current struggles is straining, members are leaving, political momentum has ceased to exist as The Dashnaktsutyun splinters into several camps. We have enough external threats, must we really have internal ones?"
 focus_arm_dashnak_chekists: "Intraparty chekists"
 focus_arm_dashnak_chekists_desc: "The smell of conspiracy reeks within Yerevan. Chekists, Red Russian agents who have infiltrated every level of our state, from government to the Army. Tensions have grown even higher with internal intelligence reports finding these agents behind the recent unrest in our west. As it seems, the line between external internal threats is all but blurred. Just last Sunday, a Chekist affiliated officer attempted to smuggle arms out of Yerevan's Armory. Even now, Armenia's enemies scheme within our very own borders, the call is coming from inside the house."
 focus_arm_dashnak_end: "The end of Dashnaktsutyun?"
 focus_arm_dashnak_end_desc: "Trust in the political union has all but dissolved in the last few months. Chekists run wild, Refugees riot, and even within the party we are not unified. Our international bureaus are beginning to cut contact with Yerevan. Several key officials within the party have already cut connections, we are left with just our ideological core which was not strong to begin with. This may spell the end of Dashnaktsutyun as we know it."
 focus_arm_four_years: "Summing up four years of rule"
 focus_arm_four_years_desc: "It's been one hell of a ride. Dashnaktsutyun’s time in the sun just might be fading into the sunset, but our four years in power might provide some insight into Armenia's future. War, famine, disease, yes we’ve had our fair share of trouble as a nation, but we’ve also had triumphs. Armenia has shown in just a handful of years that it will not go quietly into the night, and that may just continue, even without the guiding hand of The Dashnaktsutyun."

The Turks, the Russians and the Persians have tried countless times to steal our national identity and to assimilate us into their arrogant foreign empires. Yet we have persisted, and Armenia's national pride won't fall like that of our turkified neighbors. Armenia is pure, proud and strong!"
