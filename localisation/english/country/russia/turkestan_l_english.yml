 ### Events ###
 ## Starting event chain ##
 turkestan.1.t: "Labour Day Invasion"
 turkestan.1.d: "Today, on May the First, the Red Army in Kirghizstan, commanded by Mikhail Frunze, has commenced 'Operation Labour Day', beginning today, their forces will march beyond the Powerbase in Frunze and Alma-ata to attack and conquer the yet unpacified Alash Orda Government at its Western boundaries. Whever it will succeed is unsure, but there are rumours speculating that a coalition of southern warlords are planning to invade in tandem, and kick out the Reds from the region once and for all."
 turkestan.1.a: "Will it all be in vain?"
 turkestan.2.t: "The Reds attack the Alash!"
 turkestan.2.d: "Just a couple of days ago, the abhorrent forces of what they call themselves 'The Red Army of Kirghizstan' under Frunze has dared to invade our allied polity of the Alash Orda, should we retalitate?"
 turkestan.2.a: "The war is a must..."
 turkestan.2.b: "We cannot risk our country's destruction"
 turkestan.3.t: "Conflict in the North!"
 turkestan.3.d: "We have received reports from our scouts that a state of war has arrived to our immediate northern boundaries, between a multitude of states. It serves as a perfect opportunity for us to assert our control and power and to invade these barbaric warlords and to link up back to Kolchak's white russia as a final goal, until only then will central asia be under sovereign governance."
 turkestan.3.a: "We will not let the moment waver away!"
 turkestan.4.t: "Escalation of the Turkestani Wars"
 turkestan.4.d: "Our reporters have arrived with several key events that have since occurred in Central Asia, most notably, the involvement of the Pro-russian Transcaspian Government into the conflicts, of which they invade the rumored coalition between the turkic states..."
 turkestan.4.a: "This will not be good for the trout population"
 turkestan.5.t: "Coalition break-down"
 turkestan.5.d: "The Pact of Kokand, as the coalition has been coined by Western observers, has met its most troubling moment in its short history, wherein the most powerful member, the 'Basmachi Movement', a pro-islamic anti-russian confederation of various turkic chieftains and generals, have left the coalition due to internal strife and had declared war on its former members, as well as the Alash Orda, in order to achieve a 'more supreme' islamic state above all others. This is likely in response to the recent Transcaspian involvement, which had exacerbated the Turkestani situation."
 turkestan.5.a: "It was never meant to last"
 turkestan.6.t: "Our interets down south"
 turkestan.6.d: "While the war against Frunze is still raging, it is still important to question the validity of the existence of our 'allies', are they really sovereign states or are they simply lawless polities aiming to achieve local interests over their nations? Should we not involve ourselves in this debacle and free the Kirghiz and the Karakalpak that are oppressed by their brutal regimes? We will send out notices to Khiva and Bukhara to demand their immediate surrender to us and the seizure of their state property to our men."
 turkestan.6.a: "I really hope this works..."
 turkestan.7.t: "Alash demands our Annexation!"
 turkestan.7.d: "Are we not at war, with a common enemy? Or do they simply want to provide a way to serve their own interests? We must respond to this issue immediately!"
 turkestan.7.a: "It is better than the alternative"
 turkestan.7.b: "A show of force will damn them well"
 turkestan.8.t: "An opportunity arises"
 turkestan.8.d: "Now that most of our neighbours, actually, all of them, are in a bit of a pickle, why don't we take an advantage of the situation and attack ourselves? It is our duty to liberate all the peasantry of fergana, and perhaps the whole of Transcaspia, after all..."
 turkestan.8.a: "Pacifists be damned"
 ## Unification events ##
 # BSM #
 turkestan.9.t: "The Basmachi Movement takes over Turkestan!"
 turkestan.9.d: "The Islamist Nationalist Movement, the Basmachis, have taken over the region of Central Asia, otherwise referred to as Russian Turkestan or simply Turkestan, and declared a new Emirate; The Emirate of Turkestan. For many of the muslims living there, it is a liberating moment, a break from the chains, but for now, the nation must heal, and therefore the newly-born Giant shall sleep..."
 turkestan.9.a: "Has a new Islamic golden age begun?"
 # BUK #
 turkestan.10.t: "Revival of the Bukharan Khanate"
 turkestan.10.d: "The Emirate of Bukhara, an Uzbeg Polity with certain Mongolic dynastic roots, has usurped all of its opponents in the Central Asian region, and declared a new Khanate; the Khanate of Bukhara, with the former Emir, now Khan, at its helm. The Bukharan's History has been dominated by both peace and conflict, war and truces, a history of independence and vassalisation, but now they remain true to their own ideals. No longer shall they be the ones being dominated, it is now their turn to dominate their neighbours instead. Unless..."
 turkestan.10.a: "Are we living in the Future or in History?"
 # KAZ #
 turkestan.11.t: "Alash Victorious"
 turkestan.11.d: "The Alash Orda, also known as the State of Alash, or the State of Qazaqs by their most dominant group, have took over Turkestan and cemented their control. The local offices, from Ashgabat to Alash-qala, now carry Alash Party Emblems in their main halls. The Children are waking them to be not under War, but under peace. The People are not Turkomen, or Uzbegs, but Turks, the Turks of the Turkestani Union of Alash."
 turkestan.11.a: "A New era has arisen, but is it meant to last?"
 # KHI #
 turkestan.12.t: "Khwarazmen is on the map Again!"
 turkestan.12.d: "The Khanate of Khiva, once a single Russian Vassal occupying a small area south of the Aral sea, now occupies much of the lands around it, from the eastern shores of the Caspian, to the troublesome borders of far western China, the Khwarazmenian empire has been re-established, this time under Turkic rule, with Xiva at its center, and the Chagatay language taught throughout. They are not Kirghiz or Qazaqs, they are now citizens of the New Khwarazmenian Empire."
 turkestan.12.a: "The Mongols won't end them this time"
 # KYR #
 turkestan.13.t: "Establishment of the Turkestani SSR"
 turkestan.13.d: "A New dawn has risen on the lands of Central Asia, a Red dawn, a Red dawn for a Red morning. Today, the Tadzik Citizens of Khujand find themselves not as Tadziks, but as Turkestanis, and not in Khujand, but in Raximboyevsk, named after a local revolutionary. The Kirghiz SSR under the command of Mikhail Frunze has conquered its adversaries and established the Turkestan Socialist Soviet Republic. A Soviet-aligned regime now dominates the Russian South..."
 turkestan.13.a: "Death to the Bourgeoisie; Glory to the Proletariat!"
 # MNS #
 turkestan.14.t: "Monstrov Unifies Turkestan"
 turkestan.14.d: "A Church bell rings in the old town's center, a construct, centuries of age, but little are left to attend the weekly Divine Liturgy, for merely the majority of the town has been whisked away under mysterious circumstances. Nobody knows where they have gone, where they are, or why they have disappeared, but what is known to those inhabitants, and the people of the church, is that they are not alone; Hundreds of small towns and villages just like them have been the target of a yet unnamed Governmental programme, just one of the many that have appeared since the Government's consolidation over the area; The unification of Turkestan, under Konstantin Monstrov's Forces."
 turkestan.14.a: "A sight to behold; a land to avoid"
 # TMS #
 turkestan.15.t: "Russian Legions Unify Turkestan"
 turkestan.15.d: "From a Russian, to a Russian, Fyodor Funtikov Messaged the AFSR's head office in Krasnodar today to inform them of his success, this time a prize they have never seen before; The whole of Turkestan, under Russian white control. The politics in Transcaspia are difficult to pin down, but the social democratic Esery-Menshevik coalition that has lead Transcaspia has emerged victorious for one final battle, the battle of Turkestan, and they have won. Now its time for the Nation to naturally progress, the White armies to settle unruly areas, and law & order to be restored."
 turkestan.15.a: "It's as if Nothing ever happened"

 ### Ideas ###
 BSM_envers_personality_cult: "Enver Pasha's Personality Cult"
 BSM_envers_personality_cult_desc: "Enver Pasha, perhaps one of the most controversial figures in recent history, has helped establish a Turkic movement in Central Asia with the help of his supporters. The crimes he commited against the Armenian Population in the Ottoman Empire and the ensuing Turkish Civil War caused him to flee to Turkestan. Now, Enver has build a strong personality cult centered around him and his Pan-Turkic, now moderately islamic ideology. §RIn fact, many people are starting to worship him as a prophet, which could have fatal consequences...§!"
