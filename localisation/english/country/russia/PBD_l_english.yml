 POLITICS_TUKHACHEVSKY_DESC: "Red Napoleon who, to some extent, was able to reveal his potential. After a successful breakthrough through the Vistula and a successful containment of the advance of German troops, he was able to gain a foothold in the area from Germany to Bellorus. The situation in the civil war forced him to stay in this place. I will assail the alliance, but the defeat of the German Empire made the Entente only stronger, the capitalist interventionists can return at any moment. And Marshal wants to be ready for this moment."
