 ## Events
 tms.1.t: "The 1924 Election"
 tms.1.d: "The time has come to choose a new leader. Times may be tough, but democracy is important to maintain in a state such as ours. We will only collect votes from areas we deem reliable, such as from the coast or the cities, where the ballot is less likely to be affected by scroungers and bandits."
 tms.1.a: "The Esery leader Viktor Chernov secures the vote!"
 tms.1.b: "Fyodor Funtikov wins a second term"
 tms.1.c: "The People demand Martov!"
 tms.2.t: "Savitsky Marches on Ashkhabad!"
 tms.2.d: "Our recent election has left a few vacant roles in government as a result of power change. Using this as an opportunity, the Major-general Ippolit Savitsky declared his intentions to launch a peaceful coup, urging us to step down and accept his demands. If he wins, he will secure the state against the people's wishes, and move to a greater scale of militarism."
 tms.2.a: "He marched in drunk and became dishonourably discharged."
 tms.2.b: "He convinced just enough people for the conspiracy to succeed."
 tms.3.t: "The British Expedtition withdraws from Transcaspia"
 tms.3.d: "The deteriorating influence of the British has caused their supply situation to degrade, oftentimes being unable to find a route home. This is because of declining relations between the Qajars, the Afghans and the Indian warlords, where they were simply unable to secure a route home. Luckily, in a recent deal, the Qajars have accepted a route of safe passage for any Britsh expeditionary forces still left fighting in Russia. This has allowed ones not too unlike Malleson's to finally return home. And thus came the time where we are now."
 tms.3.a: "A Shame, but at least the Basmachi will lose credibility over the argument that we are merely a puppet."
 tms.4.t: "Radicals demand socialist economic policy!"
 tms.4.d: "Opening up the market, even if for just a little, has upset many hardline socialists within our ranks, leading to a wide range of objections from minor to major. Whatever the action that the government takes, there will be a clearly defined group of people that have declared their interests in more of a planned economic model rather than one where capitalism could thrive."
 tms.4.a: "Fine, have your stupid mixed economy"
