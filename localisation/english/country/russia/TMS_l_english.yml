 ## Events
 tms.1.t: "The 1924 Election"
 tms.1.d: "The time has come to choose a new leader. Times may be tough, but democracy is important to maintain in a state such as ours. We will only collect votes from areas we deem reliable, such as from the coast or the cities, where the ballot is less likely to be affected by scroungers and bandits."
 tms.1.a: "The Esery leader Viktor Chernov secures the vote!"
 tms.1.b: "Fyodor Funtikov wins a second term"
 tms.1.c: "The People demand Martov!"
 tms.2.t: "Savitsky Marches on Ashkhabad!"
 tms.2.d: "Our recent election has left a few vacant roles in government as a result of power change. Using this as an opportunity, the Major-general Ippolit Savitsky declared his intentions to launch a peaceful coup, urging us to step down and accept his demands. If he wins, he will secure the state against the people's wishes, and move to a greater scale of militarism."
 tms.2.a: "He marched in drunk and became dishonourably discharged."
 tms.2.b: "He convinced just enough people for the conspiracy to succeed."
 tms.3.t: "The British Expedtition withdraws from Transcaspia"
 tms.3.d: "The deteriorating influence of the British has caused their supply situation to degrade, oftentimes being unable to find a route home. This is because of declining relations between the Qajars, the Afghans and the Indian warlords, where they were simply unable to secure a route home. Luckily, in a recent deal, the Qajars have accepted a route of safe passage for any Britsh expeditionary forces still left fighting in Russia. This has allowed ones not too unlike Malleson's to finally return home. And thus came the time where we are now."
 tms.3.a: "A Shame, but at least the Basmachi will lose credibility over the argument that we are merely a puppet."
 tms.4.t: "Radicals demand socialist economic policy!"
 tms.4.d: "Opening up the market, even if for just a little, has upset many hardline socialists within our ranks, leading to a wide range of objections from minor to major. Whatever the action that the government takes, there will be a clearly defined group of people that have declared their interests in more of a planned economic model rather than one where capitalism could thrive."
 tms.4.a: "Fine, have your stupid mixed economy"
 tms.5.t: "The Basmachi Issue"
 tms.5.d: "One of the largest problems facing our country are issues surrounding the Basmachi, a pan-turkic organisation hellbent on erasing Russian influence in the region and conspiring to create a greater Turkestan. While this goal is noble it also means that we are at great odds to the movement, and as such they have for many years launched unprompted raids into our territory be it sabotaging our industry or blowing up our railways, terrorising our people. As we are securing our state it is time to finally take up a method that will solve this."
 tms.5.a: "We should try to be peaceful and come to an agreement"
 tms.5.b: "No talks with an ottoman-era general, nor his goons"
 tms.6.t: "Transcaspia requests peaceful withdrawal of Basmachi agents"
 tms.6.d: "The Transcaspian Government has asked us to withdraw our resistance units from their territories in exchange for peaceful cooperation."
 tms.6.a: "The operation isn't succeeding anymway"
 tms.6.b: "No! We will keep pushing!"
 tms.7.t: "Basmachi forces withdraw"
 tms.7.d: "The Basmachi movement has accepted to withdraw their agents from our territories and forbid any more operations. The only elements left are minor allied groups which are not under the direct control of the movement."
 tms.7.a: "Transcaspia is healing"
 tms.8.t: "Basmachi rejects our offer"
 tms.8.d: "Our efforts at attempting to peacefully communicate with them have only led to an exacerbation of resistance activity, with Enver's rejection, our stability has taken a slight decline."
 tms.8.a: "Such is the trouble of governing a turkic nation"
