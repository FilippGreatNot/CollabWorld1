 ### Events ###

 stan.1.t: "Labour Day Invasion"
 stan.1.d: "Today, on May the First, the Red Army in Kirghizstan, commanded by Mikhail Frunze, has commenced 'Operation Labour Day', beginning today, their forces will march beyond the Powerbase in Frunze and Alma-ata to attack and conquer the yet unpacified Alash Orda Government at its Western boundaries. Whever it will succeed is unsure, but there are rumours speculating that a coalition of southern warlords are planning to invade in tandem, and kick out the Reds from the region once and for all."
 stan.1.a: "Will it all be in vain?"

 stan.2.t: "The Reds attack the Alash!"
 stan.2.d: "Just a couple of days ago, the abhorrent forces of what they call themselves 'The Red Army of Kirghizstan' under Frunze has dared to invade our allied polity of the Alash Orda, should we retalitate?"
 stan.2.a: "The war is a must..."
 stan.2.b: "We cannot risk our country's destruction"

 stan.3.t: "Conflict in the North!"
 stan.3.d: "We have received reports from our scouts that a state of war has arrived to our immediate northern boundaries, between a multitude of states. It serves as a perfect opportunity for us to assert our control and power and to invade these barbaric warlords and to link up back to Kolchak's white russia as a final goal, until only then will central asia be under sovereign governance."
 stan.3.a: "We will not let the moment waver away!"

 stan.4.t: "Escalation of the Turkestani Wars"
 stan.4.d: "Our reporters have arrived with several key events that have since occurred in Central Asia, most notably, the involvement of the Pro-russian Transcaspian Government into the conflicts, of which they invade the rumored coalition between the turkic states..."
 stan.4.a: "This will not be good for the trout population"

 stan.5.t: "Coalition break-down"
 stan.5.d: "The Pact of Kokand, as the coalition has been coined by Western observers, has met its most troubling moment in its short history, wherein the most powerful member, the 'Basmachi Movement', a pro-islamic anti-russian confederation of various turkic chieftains and generals, have left the coalition due to internal strife and had declared war on its former members, as well as the Alash Orda, in order to achieve a 'more supreme' islamic state above all others. This is likely in response to the recent Transcaspian involvement, which had exacerbated the Turkestani situation."
 stan.5.a: "It was never meant to last"

 stan.6.t: "Our interets down south"
 stan.6.d: "While the war against Frunze is still raging, it is still important to question the validity of the existence of our 'allies', are they really sovereign states or are they simply lawless polities aiming to achieve local interests over their nations? Should we not involve ourselves in this debacle and free the Kirghiz and the Karakalpak that are oppressed by their brutal regimes? We will send out notices to Khiva and Bukhara to demand their immediate surrender to us and the seizure of their state property to our men."
 stan.6.a: "I really hope this works..."

 stan.7.t: "Alash demands our Annexation!"
 stan.7.d: "Are we not at war, with a common enemy? Or do they simply want to provide a way to serve their own interests? We must respond to this issue immediately!"
 stan.7.a: "It is better than the alternative"
 stan.7.b: "A show of force will damn them well"

 stan.8.t: "An opportunity arises"
 stan.8.d: "Now that most of our neighbours, actually, all of them, are in a bit of a pickle, why don't we take an advantage of the situation and attack ourselves? It is our duty to liberate all the peasantry of fergana, and perhaps the whole of Transcaspia, after all..."
 stan.8.a: "Pacifists be damned"
