 ### Focuses ###
 ## SOV_first_tree ##
 SOV_first_end_of_civil_war_question: "End of the Civil War?"
 SOV_first_end_of_civil_war_question_desc: "Ura, comrades! The working class... won? Ura? Unfortunately, not completely. Despide the rest of the Russian Empire (expect its far western lands) was liberated, our country is destroyed by internal party struggle, economical crisis and uncertainity. Yes, comrade Lenin does firmly rule the party. But how long will it stay that way? Not much time is left for him, so we have to prepare for transfer of power and fixing of some crisis situations."
 
 SOV_first_outcome_of_the_unfinished_revolution: "Outcome of the Unfinished Revolution"
 SOV_first_outcome_of_the_unfinished_revolution_desc: "Despite our efforts, Kolchak and other reactionary thugs are still sitting behind the Urals. And they do not only drink tea there. To save our achievements, we should prepare the people, the army, the party and the industry for an inevitable showdown with the counter-revolution. The best manufacturers and soldiers, as well as their equipment, are with the whites, so we have to start from scratch."
 
 SOV_first_end_the_war_communism: "End the War Communism"
 SOV_first_end_the_war_communism_desc: "War communism as an economical model made sense duting our war against the whites. Now, however, when active combat has ended, war communism only does harm. We should fully renounce the policy and start the development of the New Economic Policy project."
 
 SOV_first_introduce_the_prodnalog: "Introduce the Prodnalog"
 SOV_first_introduce_the_prodnalog_desc: "Prodrazverstka is, in substance, a product of the bloody dictatorship of the White regime. After the end of active warfare there's no point of this policy's continuation, and we can replace it with a softer taxation system."
 
 SOV_first_start_collectivisation: "Start Collectivisation"
 SOV_first_start_collectivisation_desc: "The project of unification of agriculture equipment of peasants from one village into a single collective organisation will not only allow us to do a step to a society without private property, but also will give us an incredible food production boost we needed so hard."
 
 SOV_first_the_effectiveness_of_violence: "The Effectiveness of Violence"
 SOV_first_the_effectiveness_of_violence_desc: "It seems like not everyone is pleased with the start of collectivisation. Well, that is bad. For them. Using the system of VChK, we will quickly wipe out all the sabotage attempts against the reforms we started."
 
 SOV_first_loyalty_to_the_revolution: "Loyalty to the Revolution"
 SOV_first_loyalty_to_the_revolution_desc: "We have completed our objectives. Collectivisation is in progress and it's in a great progress. For this result, we must thank not only the VChK, but the ordinary folk as well. Despite the marginal elemts, the most of the society openly supported and helped our reforms. We must soften in return. The party understand, how hard it is for the people, as no one else."
 
 SOV_first_finish_the_dekulakalisation: "Finish the Dekulakalisation"
 SOV_first_finish_the_dekulakalisation_desc: "\"Kulaks\", \"robust farmers\", \"bag people\". All these epithets mean a single thing — disease. A purulent ulcer on the body of the Soviet society grows on a agricultural disctric and feeds on suffering and resources of ordinary peasants. For the common good, we must amputate this sore."
 
 SOV_first_the_final_solution_of_the_peasant_question: "The Final Solution of the Peasant Question"
 SOV_first_the_final_solution_of_the_peasant_question_desc: "Despite our love and care for the peasant people, these relations do not seem mutual. Too much dissatisfaction and open rebellion have come from the countryside, so to preserve the gains of the revolution, we must overcome the peasants in their social ignorance, one way or another." #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_first_carrot_and_stick_method: "Carrot and Stick Method"
 SOV_first_carrot_and_stick_method_desc: "To ensure victory in the war against the most reactionary elements of the peasantry, we must use their main adversary - the rural poor and the few who have been allies of Soviet power from its earliest days. Through our actions, we must send a clear message to all peasants: if you are with the Soviets, you will have everything you need and more, but if you oppose us, you will lose everything you had. Everything, and even more." #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_first_send_vchk_to_the_unsatisfied: "Send VChK to the Unsatisfied"
 SOV_first_send_vchk_to_the_unsatisfied_desc: "More and more of our opponents among the peasants are openly confronting local leaders and Soviet authority in general, setting an example that open protests go unpunished. We will convince them otherwise. By deploying the combat reserves of the Cheka, we will compel the peasants to either fully accept our authority or face complete loss of their lives and property." #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_first_socialist_market: "Socialist Market"
 SOV_first_socialist_market_desc: "While the ideas of applying certain aspects of a market economy within the Soviet system can be seen as a betrayal of Marx's ideas, we simply must make this deal with the devil, at least temporarily. Too many resources and people have not yet adapted to the Soviet economic model, so we will make the transition to a planned economy smoother and more gradual rather than break everything hastily." #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_first_all_methods_are_good: "All Methods Are Good"
 SOV_first_all_methods_are_good_desc: "According to our reports, the New Economic Policy (NEP) has not started as effectively as we planned. Much of the bourgeoisie perceives the introduction of the NEP as the beginning of reforms towards a capitalist economy. At this point, it is unclear how far we will proceed with market experiments, but for now, we will have to calm them down and convince them that the NEP is not a temporary solution, but rather a measure to stabilize the situation in the country." #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_first_increase_the_influence_of_nep: "Increase the Influence of NEP"
 SOV_first_increase_the_influence_of_nep_desc: "It seems that the somewhat unsatisfactory growth of the NEP indicators is due to the limited participation in the economy not only by former kulaks and the bourgeoisie but also by the common people. Some are dissatisfied with our "insufficient revolutionism," while others are unsure about the stability of the NEP and prefer barter. Engaging these people in the NEP can be achieved through both voluntary and coercive methods, but this is of absolutely no concern to us. The end justifies the means, so all layers of the population will participate in the NEP, whether they want to or not." #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_first_nepmans_the_builders_of_communism: "NEPmans, the Builders of Communism"
 SOV_first_nepmans_the_builders_of_communism_desc: "Small entrepreneurs, or as they are popularly known, NEPmen, have indeed achieved good results not only for themselves but also for the country. Focusing on small business has allowed us to free up resources that would have been spent on regulation and redirect them to more essential areas. Undoubtedly, the NEP has borne its fruits and good fruits. While questions remain about the future of this economic model, for now, we can only celebrate successes and congratulate each other. Hooray, comrades!" #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_first_fate_of_the_royal_family: "Fate of the Royal Family"
 SOV_first_fate_of_the_royal_family_desc: "The word "Romanovs." How much hatred, pomposity, and cruelty it evokes. For all the years of oppressing the working people, hunting down our party comrades, and assassinating our leaders, they must pay in full!\n\nHowever, on the other hand, much of those monstrous decisions are far from Nicholas himself, not to mention the other members of the family. It would be easier for us to get rid of them, let them go to their relatives in reactionary England or Germany.\n\nBut perhaps that's not entirely right either? Maybe by ending our feud with the royal family and accepting them, we will not only show nobility on the part of the Soviet government to the world and our own citizens, but also turn this against the reactionaries beyond the Urals. In any case, the approval of the monarchs by the Soviet authorities would be extremely inconvenient for the monarchist propaganda machine, and if we are lucky, it will persuade some Whites to join our side and sow chaos among the ranks of the reactionaries.\n\nEither way, the final decision rests with Comrade Lenin." #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_first_lenins_speech: "Lenin's Speech"
 ## SOV_stalin_tree ##
 SOV_stalin_faithful_leninist_in_power: "Faithful Leninist in Power"
 SOV_stalin_faithful_leninist_in_power_desc: "Comrade Stalin, as a kind of socialist conservative, will continue what the great Lenin started. His legacy will live forever!" #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_stalin_estimate_the_ulyanovs_work: "Estimate the Ulyanov's Work"
 SOV_stalin_estimate_the_ulyanovs_work_desc: "The achievements of Lenin are difficult to underestimate, but they are also easy to overestimate. For the sake of the revolution, we must evaluate all the outcomes of Comrade Ulyanov's actions with a cool head and mathematical precision. Yes, Petrograd, Moscow, and a large part of industrial and human resources are in our hands, but beyond the Urals, Reaction still threatens us." #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_stalin_army_reorganization: "Army Reorganization"
 SOV_stalin_army_reorganization_desc: "The Worker-Peasant Red Army is currently in an incredibly dire state: low discipline and training among the ranks, monstrous incompetence among the officer corps, supply problems, and a lack of coherent tactics and strategy. Comrade Stalin, along with Comrade Budyonny, Comrade Zhukov, and other experienced and influential officers of the Red Army, must undertake serious efforts to reorganize the country's military forces. What talk of a "world revolution" can there be when a sudden strike from White bandits in the east could completely crush us?" #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_stalin_suppress_the_resistance: "Suppress the Resistance"
 SOV_stalin_suppress_the_resistance_desc: "The practical experience gained during the reorganization of the Red Army has revealed one truth: in the best case scenario, the rank and file soldiers and officers simply have no understanding of the ideals of communism, and in the worst case, they are blatant traitors to the socialist homeland, ready to defect to the enemy and fight against us at the first opportunity. To address this problem, political commissars will be assigned to the units. Their role will be to educate the personnel about the basics of communism, to support the Red Army warriors on the battlefield, and in cases of extreme necessity, to execute soldiers who falter." #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_stalin_fate_of_the_revisionists: "Fate of the Revisionists"
 SOV_stalin_fate_of_the_revisionists_desc: "Revisionism is almost as dangerous as Reaction itself. Attempts to revise the fundamental ideas of Marx must be punished, and punished relentlessly." #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_stalin_serve_the_revolution_by_deed: "Serve the Revolution by Deed"
 SOV_stalin_serve_the_revolution_by_deed_desc: "In essence, revisionism is the product of idleness and intellectual fragmentation. If we deal with revisionists decisively, they will quickly feel the steadfast adherence to all fundamental ideals of Marx on their own skin." #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_stalin_make_them_work: "Make Them Work"
 SOV_stalin_make_them_work_desc: "As expected, it will require a significant amount of time for re-education through labor. This is advantageous for us! By organizing special corrective labor camps and consolidating their management under a single People's Commissariat, we will not only ensure the implementation of the re-education program but also increase industrial output across the country. Labor will free their minds from the shackles of revisionism!" #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_stalin_be_useful_by_skills: "Be Useful by Skills"
 SOV_stalin_be_useful_by_skills_desc: "Revisionists, in many cases, are outstanding politicians, scholars, military personnel, industrialists, and others who contribute to the country with their skills. By directing their energy away from revisionism and towards serving our socialist homeland, we can save them from the dreadful fate of the enemies of the people. Perhaps, we can also help them overcome various misconceptions about Marx's teachings." #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_stalin_knights_of_the_revolution: "Knights of the Revolution"
 SOV_stalin_knights_of_the_revolution_desc: "Those whom we previously disdainfully labeled as "revisionists" now provide invaluable assistance every day to our young state and the great working-peasant people. We must convey to the public that they have traversed a thorny path to redemption, abandoned their old revisionist tendencies, and now proudly bear the name — Knights of the Revolution!" #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_stalin_end_of_nep: "The End of NEP"
 SOV_stalin_end_of_nep_desc: "The so-called New Economic Policy (NEP) was a necessary measure during Lenin's time. Now, the need for it has passed. The country's course will now be directed towards mass industrialization and modernization of the entire nation. Let's get to work!" #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_stalin_expand_the_industry: "Expand the Industry"
 SOV_stalin_expand_the_industry_desc: "To say that our industry is weak would be an understatement. Its current state cannot even meet the basic needs of the Soviet country. To rectify this, we must use the resources gained from the abolition of the NEP to construct new military factories and expand existing ones." #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 SOV_stalin_country_infrastructure: "Country Infrastructure"
 SOV_stalin_country_infrastructure_desc: "With the red flag flying over most of the former Prison of Peoples, we must ensure the country's powerful infrastructure.

On every corner of our cities, on every page of our newspapers, on every meter of walls, the image of our Leader should shine, which by his example should provide a high ideal.  Hundreds of thousands of mouthpieces every day will have to broadcast speeches and quotes from Stalin, in schools every lesson should mention his name, his portrait will hang in every home, and his wisdom should be ranked alongside the greatest philosophers of antiquity and modernity...maybe even taller than his old comrades..." #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
