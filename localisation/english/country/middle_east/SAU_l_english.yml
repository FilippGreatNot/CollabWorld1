 SAU_strenghten_the_sultanates_authority_desc: "In the last few years since the Fall of the Ottoman Empire, we have achieved many victories in our goal to unify the Arabian Peninsula under our rightful control. However, we still face many enemies and internal problems. We are still a desert at best. We need to face our problems, and we will begin to do so by strenghtening the Sultan's authority over the peninsula."
 SAU_treaty_of_al_uqair: "Sign the Treaty of Al-Uqair"
 SAU_treaty_of_al_uqair_desc: "Ever since the events of the Fall of the Ottoman Empire, we have had a border dispute.

This will help ease regional tensions and improve our relations, perhaps saving our independence in the future."
 SAU_consult_the_ulema: "Consult the Ulema"
 SAU_consult_the_ulema_desc: "The Holy Quran is the constitution of the Saudi state and therefore, we must enshrine islamic values in our law and decisionmaking processes.

The scholars of islam will make sure that we follow the true islamic methodology and make our state truly be the Land of Tawheed."
