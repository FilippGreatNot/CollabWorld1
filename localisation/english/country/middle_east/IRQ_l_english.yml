 IRQ_power_struggle_decisions: "The Reformist-Traditionalist Conflict"
 IRQ_BOOKMARK_DESC: "With the Collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the hands of the British Empire and the sudden withdrawal of the British Armed Forces from the peninsula, Iraq is finally fully independent under the leadership of the Hashemite King Faisal I. Maybe now, Iraq can stand as a proud free nation and make a change in the world by either expanding for its national interests, becoming economically powerful or perhaps even uniting the Arab peoples. The future of Iraq is yet to be decided, and many seek to take the reins and shape the future as they wish."

 ### Focuses ###
 IRQ_first_the_cradle_of_civilization: "The Cradle of Civilization"
 IRQ_first_the_cradle_of_civilization_desc: "Iraq can be considered one of the oldest civilized regions in the world. Many nations and civilizations have arisen and fallen in Mesopotamia, but eventually for hundreds of years we ended up being oppressed by both the Safavid and Ottoman Empires. Now, through the events of the Great War and the involvment of the Ottoman Empire on the side of the Central Powers, we have gained independence through the help of the British with the Hashemite dynasty as our leading force. Now that the British have pulled out of the region, we can finally bring glory to Iraq and Arabia in general. Under the genius leadership of Faisal the Unifier, we will be able to achieve many great things for for this country. May Allah be on our side. For Iraq! The Land of the Two Rivers and the Cradle of Civilization!"
 IRQ_first_the_hashemite_king: "The Hashemite King"
 IRQ_first_the_hashemite_king_desc: "The Hashemite House, which is responsible for the liberation of the Middle East from Ottoman rule, are direct descendants of the Messanger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him. They are fit to rule and have shown their genius and prowess countles time. The Hashemite King Faisal, the most favored of the 3 hashemite kings, is beloved by our people and must be given full permission to shape Iraq in his vision."
 IRQ_first_introduce_administrative_reforms: "Introduce Administrative Reforms"
 IRQ_first_introduce_administrative_reforms_desc: "Iraq's administrative system is old compared to the modern western systems which lead their countries to bureaucratic succes. We must reform our administration, even if it might upset some of the tribes in the country. For the long term, such reforms will help us establish a stable Iraqi state."
 IRQ_first_buy_american_guns: "Buy American Guns"
 IRQ_first_buy_american_guns_desc: "Truth be told, our army is not up to modern standards at all and can even be considered a hundred years behind in military technology such as weapons. In order to resolve this issue, we will purchase some guns from the corporate Rockefeller regime in order to modernize our Armed Forces. Considering the innovation of the Springfield Arms Corporation which is responsible for the production of weapons for the American corporate militaries, this deal should be more than perfect for the strenghtening of our armed forces."
 IRQ_first_modernize_our_infrastructure: "Modernize Our Infrastructure"
 IRQ_first_modernize_our_infrastructure_desc: "Iraq's infrastructure is extremely rural and our cities are not well connected. If we are to fit into the global economy and reach the same standards of speed and communications like the west one day, we must start to modernize and expand our roads and rework the tight roads in major cities. Only by doing this will be able to bring about the full reorganization and modernization of the Iraqi economy."
 IRQ_first_seek_foreign_investments: "Seek Foreign Investments"
 IRQ_first_seek_foreign_investments_desc: "In order to strenghten the economic strength of the Iraqi nation, we will need to utilize the financial help of the great powers of this world. We will seek foreign investments in order to make Baghdad the center of the Region again. To do this, we will invite Soviet, French and British ambassadors and ask them to send a message of financial possibilities and vast opportunities to their government. Through the support of the Poeers of the World, Iraq shall take their place as the Global Superpower just again! Like in the Abbasid Era!"
 IRQ_first_deal_with_the_rising_sun: "A Deal with the Rising Sun"
 IRQ_first_deal_with_the_rising_sun_desc: "It has become evident that the European Hegemony which has defined the world for the last 2 centuries might be at an end. Therefore, it is only logical that we should also cooperate with the powers of our own continent. One of them, and arguably the greatest one, is the Rising Sun. The land of pink trees and financial opportunity. We will help establish a Japanese embassy and seek to make a trade deal with the country. We will give them oil, and they can give us whichever modern industrial consumer goods they have. In the end, this deal will strenghten both of our countries in order to combat the evident Western Imperialism which seeks to destroy us."
 IRQ_first_invest_in_industrialization: "Invest in Industrialization"
 IRQ_first_invest_in_industrialization_desc: "Though the Western powers weren’t here for long, they left behind some ideas we can use. We must seize the land wasting away in the nobles hands so that it can be used to actually benefit the state with new factory jobs. With this, we can begin to lay the groundwork for a modern state fit to defend itself. As it stands now, we would roll over and die at the first sign of hostilities. The only solution to this is a modern industry that can produce the best equipment in the middle east. The road to modernity is long and far from easy, but it will prove worthwhile when our grandchildren will grow up feeling safe."
 IRQ_first_introduce_land_reforms: "Introduce Land Reforms"
 IRQ_first_introduce_land_reforms_desc: "Rather than rapidly industrializing, we should first reform the system of land ownership in Iraq. Currently, a ton of land is owned by tribes and old governates. We need to seize this land as government properly and redestribute it accordingly. On top of that, we must change the system of land inheritance and record land ownership better than before. Doing this, while perhaps challenging or seemingly useless right now, will bear many fruits in the future."
 IRQ_first_kirkuk_oil_discovery: "The Kirkuk Oil Discovery"
 IRQ_first_kirkuk_oil_discovery_desc: "In the region of Kirkuk, we have discovered major amounts of oil which is becoming an ever more important resource in the modern age of vehicles and tanks. Therefore, we must use this discovery in order to receive a significant economic boost and get even more countries to buy their oil straight from Iraq. This will bring us a ton of money."
 IRQ_first_baghdad_power_plant: "Build the Baghdad Power Plant"
 IRQ_first_baghdad_power_plant_desc: "Once, Baghdad was the center of it all. People would travel from all over the world just to see what Baghdad had to offer. But now, it is little more than just another city with some historical relevance. If we are to bring this city back to prominence, we must first bring it up to the standards of more advanced cities. Between the oil supply we sit on alongside the historical relevance of Baghdad, this will be where we begin the march to greatness. We will provide this once great city with power for it to begin its recovery towards prestige once again."
 IRQ_first_preserve_iraqi_cultural_heritage: "Preserve Iraqi Cultural Heritage"
 IRQ_first_preserve_iraqi_cultural_heritage_desc: "Iraq has been a home of many civilizations and great cultures and a millenium ago, we were also the scentifical, cultural and even economical center of the world in the Islamic Golden Age. These times are long gone. The Iraqi nation has been left stranded by its enemies. We hold no real power on the world stage and our people's safety has been compromised. But even with all of this, we have to continue being resilient in keeping our culture safe and expanding its popularity around the world. We must focus on preserving the ruins of old civilizations, teach the Armenian Migrants about our traditions and do anything in order to ensure that our Iraqi culture stays afloat. After all, which people can survive if they do not posses a culture which makes them into one people?"
 IRQ_first_calm_down_the_tribes: "Calm Down the Tribes"
 IRQ_first_calm_down_the_tribes_desc: "Although Iraq looks united on a map, that is far from the case on the ground. There are numerous tribes and regional factions who consider themselves everything from autonomous provinces to their own states entirely. Fortunately for us, they are also disunited and therefore weak. They all have their own wants and needs and therefore can be dealt with. We will tackle these factions one by one before they ever get the idea to unite against us. Though they are against us, they are still our cultural brethren, leaving diplomacy as a viable option for many of these tribes. Let us hope, violence does not have to be one of these options."
 IRQ_first_minimize_the_sectarian_divide: "Minimize the Sectarian Divide"
 IRQ_first_minimize_the_sectarian_divide_desc: "If there is one constant about religions, it is sectarian divides. Islam is no different when it comes to this issue. Fortunately, at the end of the day, we all agree on one key tennant: there is but one God, and Muhammad is his prophet. We must appeal to them not as Sunni or Shia, but as fellow Muslims defending our home from those who will suppress our culture. We may never truly be one true form of Islam, but thank god there are non muslims who can be used as a threat towards those who are."
 IRQ_first_iraqi_military_reforms: "Iraqi Military Reforms"
 IRQ_first_iraqi_military_reforms_desc: "The Iraqi military is in dire need of being reformed and modernized to fit western standards. We have to decide what to do with our Armed Forces and which approach we should take regarding our military doctrine and tactics. Should we be offensive or focus on the defense of the Iraqi nation? Some voices in the military are however suggestinng that maybe if we want to defend Iraq Faisal I might not be the best choice as the leader... we shall see."
 IRQ_first_the_iraqi_government_printing_press: "The Iraqi Government Printing Press"
 IRQ_first_the_iraqi_government_printing_press_desc: "If there’s one thing that always works on a population, it’s propaganda. However, that will only work if the people can read, which is not a common commodity around these parts. By investing in an Iraqi printing press, we can begin to fight illiteracy and boost our population's knowledge. Plus, an illiterate population can’t read propaganda, and that is something we would like. Once our population can read, they will be able to achieve greater and greater heights enriching the state in the process."
 IRQ_first_reestablish_university: "Re-Establish the Al-Mustansiriya University"
 IRQ_first_reestablish_university_desc: "The Al-Mustansiriya is a famous university in Baghdad from the Abbasid Times. We need to strenghten our research abilities and improve the education in Iraq in order to become the center of global innovation once again like a thousand years before. We must also give them the funds they need in order to be able to achieve this. Hire workers in order to rebuild it and prepare it for modern use."
 IRQ_first_a_unified_iraq: "A Unified Iraq"
 IRQ_first_a_unified_iraq_desc: "Now we might finally be able to end the segragation and instability that has plagued Iraqi society for many centuries. Maybe now we can finally have a stable country free of violence and sectarian hate. This will finally allow us to prosper as a nation and become more powerful than ever before. Before that happens, we will have to introduce many measures to unite the country both administrativly and socialy. To start, Faisal I will make a speech. He is known as the Unifier for a reason."
 IRQ_first_faisals_constitutional_reforms: "King Faisal's Constitutional Reforms"
 IRQ_first_a_change_of_plan: "A Change of Plan"
 IRQ_first_a_change_of_plan_desc: "As democratic reforms were being considered, we had to take a step back and remember what we were doing. We were going to throw away everything just to mimic those who slaughtered us and treated us as less than subhuman? And look at where those ideas got them, collapse and ruin. It has been shown in both Western and Eastern examples that a wise ruler can bring prosperity to all their subjects. Though the reformists will not be pleased, we must show them we know what is best."
 IRQ_first_promote_womens_rights: "Promote Women's Rights"
 IRQ_first_promote_womens_rights_desc: "We understand that women and men are different, but we simply don't have enough manpower in both the military and the workforce in order to sustain our country. We must give women more societal roles in order to strenghten Iraq as a whole and bring it up to western standards. We must promote their institutional rights and give them mandatory education just as we gave the men. By doing this, we can reform our country and make sure our societal order is up to modern organizational standards."
 IRQ_first_entrench_traditional_gender_roles: "Entrench Traditional Gender Roles"
 IRQ_first_entrench_traditional_gender_roles_desc: "The western empires, while they were here, tried to promote many dangerous ideas and ideologies. If we left these continue, we will descend into the same degeneracy we are seeing across Western Europe. One of these is the so called feminist movement. The truth is that the two sexes are simply different from one another and therefore have different roles in our society. They are both equal in the sight of God, but the woman is to take care of the household. It is not her role to have a job or serve in the military. These leftist degenerate ideas must be eliminated in the name of the Iraqi monarchy and our Traditional Values."
 IRQ_first_introduce_western_court_systems: "Introduce Western Court Systems"
 IRQ_first_introduce_western_court_systems_desc: "As anyone with eyes can tell you, the old ways are falling behind the western system and leading us to disarray and failure. As far as I am concerned, western laws are the only path to survival. Their establishments have led to prosperity and wealth that surpassed any we have done before. Some will say it also leads to ruin, but this is simply not the case. Their collapse was due to their hubris and fragile egos leading to their constant feuds with each other. We have seen the failures of their leadership and can avoid their mistakes in order to achieve the prosperity the middle east has always had the potential to achieve."
 IRQ_first_support_the_islamic_courts: "Support the Islamic Courts"
 IRQ_first_support_the_islamic_courts_desc: "In their ever growing hubris and ignorance, there is a faction amongst us who believe in throwing out the islamic laws in favour of a western legal system. These are obviously western spies who are hellbent on destroying our way of life. We must throw our whole weight behind those who are loyal to Iraq and wish to preserve our unique culture. Those who believe in the west preach efficiency and call it “the only path to survival.” These people obviously have never studied a day of our history, Islamic law has served us well for over 1000 years. Our failures were the failures of Constantinople, not those of our ancestors. With the Turks out of the picture, we will prove why our ancestors looked to these laws and why they worked."

 IRQ_first_rule_with_the_iron_fist: "Rule with the Iron Fist"
 IRQ_first_rule_with_the_iron_fist_desc: "Faisal I should have absolute power in the country. Only with an iron fist but in a velvet glove will Iraq be a stable and orderly nation. If we let in the democratic parliamentary ideals of Europe, we will inevitable face the same fate their industrial societies did: total collapse. We don't need to collapse, we don't need the rise of radicalism in Iraq."
 IRQ_first_strike_persia: "Strike the Persian Menace"
 IRQ_first_establish_an_iraqi_parliament: "Establish an Iraqi Parliament"
 IRQ_first_establish_an_iraqi_parliament_desc: "Faisal's new constitution of 1923 has allowed us to build institutions like a parliament which will help manage the country in a way closer to the people of Iraq. Many are praising Faisal for being willing to give up some of his power to satisfy the others in the country, however some people feel like Faisal isn't fit to rule and are considering deposing him illegaly in a vote in the parliament, which could lead to the establishment of a republic and of a true democracy for Iraq. Whether this will happen is yet to be seen, but many consider it unlikely."
 IRQ_first_the_era_of_the_arabs: "The Era of the Arabs"
 IRQ_first_support_the_army_of_hejaz: "Support the Hejazi Army"
 IRQ_first_support_the_army_of_hejaz_desc: "The Hejazi State is lead by Faisal's Father. They are being attacked and provoked by the wahabbis in Riyadh which actively seek to destroy Hejaz and bring destruction to the muslim ummah. We must supply Hejaz with many guns to help them protect themselves from the Saudi threat. The Horn of the Devil in Najd must be put down."

 IRQ_first_defend_the_arab_gulf: "Defend the Arab Gulf"
 IRQ_first_defend_the_arab_gulf_desc: "We must build a naval defense force in order to defend the Arab Gulf. And no, it is not the Persian Gulf. Its the Arab Gulf. Many powers have tried to take influence over us through this strait. We must be able to project our power over it."

 IRQ_first_exploit_syrias_weakness: "Retake the Syrian Throne"
 IRQ_first_exploit_syrias_weakness_desc: "Our King Faisal I was crowned as the King of Syria before being crowned the King of Iraq, but his reign was cut short by unfortunate events. Now that our rule is soldified in Iraq and Jordan, we will retake Faisal's Original Throne and make sure its a part of our new arab kingdom. This will also give us acces to another sea, which will be great economically and strategically. With our newly gained strength, regaining Syria for the Hashemites should not be a hard task. Shahbandar has to go."

 IRQ_first_iraq_on_the_world_stage: "Iraq on the World Stage"
 IRQ_first_iraq_on_the_world_stage_desc: "With the Iraqi state having been stabilized and strenghtened in the last few years, it is time to start thinking about our actual international alignment beyond our Middle Eastern region. We can, perhaps, ally with France. They are an unlikely ally, but the growing threat of Russian Communism might cause us to thread this unholy path. Another option could be to join the New Reichspakt made by the reunified German Kaiserreich. Perhaps neither of these options are good for us. In that case, we should just stay neutral but ready for war."
 IRQ_first_preserve_iraqi_neutrality: "Preserve Iraqi Neutrality"
 IRQ_first_preserve_iraqi_neutrality_desc: "We should not align ourselves with the Western Powers. Looking at the Fall of the Ottoman Empire, we can see their doom was trying to involve themselves in a European War they had nothing to get from. We will not make the mistakes of our occupiers. Instead of aligning ourselves with the West as a doormat, we shall continue the policy of neutrality on the international stage and therefore secure peace for Iraq."
 IRQ_first_align_with_the_french: "Align with the French"
 IRQ_first_align_with_the_french_desc: "A few years ago, the French were somewhat at fault for what happened in Syria. But we must forgive them for the past. Now, both of our nations are threatened directly by Russian Communism. In order to defend ourselves from the crimson blade, we must stand together in our mutual defense. Therefore, we will apply to join the Axis of Reaction."

 IRQ_first_align_with_the_new_kaiserreich_desc: "Germany is our natural ally. They hold no colonial ambitions in the region and have actively been fighting against those empires that seeked to destroy us a few years ago. On top of that, the Berlin-Baghdad Railway Memories are still there and there are in fact many Germans living in Iraq advising our government.

 IRQ_first_iraq_promise_peace: "Promise the People Peace"
 IRQ_first_iraq_promise_peace_desc: "The last few years have been filled with war. The consequences of the Great War in the Middle East are not only present, but also rampant. Our people are tired of foreign and regional invaders trying to upset their peace and order. We must promise the people that the new regime will make sure democracy and peace are available for all Iraqis regardless of their heritage, religion, sect or really anything. Iraq is a united nation that strives for peace. We must make everyone know this."

As the defender of the Kurdish people and the Iraqi people, it is General Bakr Sidqi's obligation and commitment to defend his people no matter where they are and no matter the odds of victory. It is the right thing to do. The Persian plague ends today. Any man who oppresses the Kurds must be eliminated."

 IRQ_sawad_reformation_desc: "The Sawad, named after its dark, fertile soil, has long been the heart of southern Iraq, standing in stark contrast to the barren Arabian Desert. Today, it is home to Shi'ite Arab tribes, our most steadfast supporters. To ensure their loyalty and prosperity, we must invest in the land and uplift the working-class Arabs who toil upon it. The Sawad remains one of the few regions with true agricultural potential; it is time we harness it for the nation's future; the §GNational§! Future; the §RWorkers§! future."

 IRQ_syndicilzation_desc: "The foundation of a truly just society lies in the unification of §Rlabor§!, §Lindustry§!, and the §0state§! under a single, disciplined order. Through §Rsyndicalization§!, we shall forge a new Iraq—where the §Rworkers§!, the §0soldiers§!, and the §Gintellectuals§! march as one, not in chaos, but in perfect harmony. The days of exploitation and stagnation are over; now, all §Rproduction§! shall serve the nation, and all §Rlabor§! shall be a pillar of strength. §RSyndicalism§! is the only solution; it is the perfect plan."

 IRQ_dulaym_dismantle_desc: "The Dulaym tribe stands as the largest and most powerful tribal force in Iraq, dominating the military ranks, administrative positions, and controlling vast swathes of land in Anbar province. Their influence is a barrier to true national unity, as their loyalty lies more with tribal customs than with the state. It is time to dismantle their stranglehold, break their power, and ensure that Iraq belongs to all its people, not just one tribe."
 IRQ_new_irrigation: "Irrigate Anbar"
 IRQ_new_irrigation_desc: "The vast deserts of Anbar have long remained underutilized, dominated by the Dulaym tribe, with its potential wasted under the control of tribal landlords and outdated irrigation methods. Now that we have cleared that deplorable tribe, we can invest in modern irrigation projects, and can transform the barren lands into fertile fields, ensuring food security, boosting agricultural production, and bringing prosperity to the region.

Yet, despite its fertile lands and strategic importance, it has been neglected in favor of the cities of the north and center. By expanding industry in the south, we will bring economic prosperity, modern infrastructure, and employment to the people, ensuring they have a stake in the future of Iraq. No longer will Baghdad and Mosul reap the wealth while the south is left behind."

 ## Events ##
 
 irq.1.t: "The Cradle of Civilization"
 irq.1.d: "The Lands of Iraq, historically known as Mesopotamia, have been home to many ancient civilizations like the Assyrians or the Babylonians. These were the first civilizations that walked the face of this earth. We bear their legacy as the cradle of all progress and all the best things humanity has to offer. The Modern Iraq is a bit weak. Having gained our independence when the British Empire started to crumble after the failed attack on Northwestern Russia, we are now able to decide our own destiny, without British or Ottoman hands deciding how to opress us next. We must make Iraq strong again, either through the force of arms or through economic prowess."
 irq.1.a: "Iraq will Endure"
 irq.2.t: "The Hashemite Legacy"
 irq.2.d: "The Hashemite heritage, tracing back its roots to the Prophet Peace and Blessings be upon him, played a significant role in liberating the middle east from the corrupt ottoman government in the 1910s. Now our peninsula finaly stands independent, and 3 hashemite kings rule over 3 domains. In Jordan, the Nephew of King Faisal rules and awaits integration. In Hejaz, Faisal's father tries to endure against the Saudi menace. It is, however, most likely that Faisal will be the king if Arabia truly was to unite into a single state."
 irq.2.a: "For King Faisal!"
 irq.3.t: "The Iraqi Parliament's First Session"
 irq.3.d: "Today is the first session of the newly established Iraqi Parliament. Many are wondering how it will go and how the institution will use its new found power. Will they endorse and thank Faisal? Well, some voices are silently informing that they might be planning to oust him..."
 irq.3.a: "Long Live Faisal the Unifier!"
 irq.3.b: "No more Kings!"
 irq.4.t: "Military Reforms"
 irq.4.d: "It has become evidently clear to the government that we need to reform our military in order to be on the level of the countries around us. We need to modernize it and make it able to defend us from foreign invasions or make it more focused on offensive operations. Those are the two choices. However, the general Bakr Sidqi is considering doing a military coup to depose Faisal I, as he views him as too incompetent to properly defend Iraq from foreign countries"
 irq.4.a: "Focus on the Offensive"
 irq.4.b: "We will defend Iraq"
 irq.4.c: "Faisal's End has come"
 irq.5.t: "Iraq Seeks to Join our Faction"
 irq.5.d: "The country of Iraq has made a request to our government to have closer relationship and they have also requested that they be admited into our military pact in order to contribute to the mutual defense between our two countries, both of which have common enemies. Should we accept?"
 irq.5.a: "No, Iraq has no place here."
 irq.5.b: "Welcome Iraqi Friends!"
 irq.6.t: "Iraqi Foreign Policy"
 irq.6.d: "We have to decide which approach we will take to foreign policy. Should we seek to protect our regional interests by gaining influence over our neighbors and building our defenses, or should we seek a more important role in unifying the Arab World under one banner. King Faisal I will have to make a choice, and it will be a permanent one with consequences"
 irq.6.a: "We are the Prussia of Arabia"
 irq.6.b: "We will defend our national interests"

 irq.8.a: "We have to avoid a potential war."
 irq.8.b: "We won't give in.
 irq.9.t: "The Egyptian Question"
 irq.9.d: "Egypt is one of the last independent Arab speaking countries that could be integrated into the Hashemite Kingdom of Arabia. However, the question whether we should actually risk a war with Egypt still remains. We could technically also just ignore them and respect their independence. Maybe we can compromise, and offer them to be a protectorate. Otherwise, we can just demand they integrate directly as originally planned."
 irq.9.a: "Respect their Independence"
 irq.9.b: "Ask for their Loyalty"
 irq.9.c: "Ask for their Integration into Arabia"
 irq.10.t: "The Hashemites ask for our loyalty"

 irq.11.a: "Yasin Stays President"
 irq.11.b: "Victory for Progress"
 irq.11.c: "A National Iraq"
 irq.12.t: "The Second Wahabbi War"
 irq.12.d: "This morning, news have struck like lightning across the Middle East. The Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq under the leadership of King Faisal I has striked the Sultanate of Najd led by the Saudi Monarchy. The issues between the 2 are amongst many their views on Islam, as the Saudi Monarchy has been propagating their own view of Islam often labelled as Wahabbism. Just as 100 years ago the Ottomans fought them because of this, now the existance of the Saudi state is once again threatened by the Hashemites. The Second Wahabbi War begins."
 irq.12.a: "The Sands are Bleeding"
 irq.13.t: "Bakr Sidqi's Coup in Iraq"
 irq.13.d: "The Kurdish-Iraqi general Bakr Sidqi has couped the Iraqi monarchy and established a military regime with the help of other Kurdish figures and aristocracs. These news come as a shocking revalation as now, the fate of the Middle East might change drastically. After all, the Pan-Arab tendencies of Faisal I were viewed with great potential by the international community. Now, Iraqi policy might be more willing to serve Kurdish interests. Another group that is worried are the Assyrians, who are considering leaving the country as Bakr Sidqi is known for having commited crimes against them."
 irq.13.a: "An interesting development"
 irq.14.t: "King Faisal I Ousted in Iraq"
 irq.14.d: "The Hashemite King Faisal I has been ousted after establishing a Parliament in Iraq. These news are a big surprise, as it was expected that the constitutional reforms would actually raise support for the monarch. Instead, the plan backfired as the parliament established a Republic the very next day. These news will have major effects on the region as now, another country in the Middle East has become democratic. However, there are many figures who would like to see an end to this new democracy..."
 irq.14.a: "His plan didn't work."
 irq.15.t: "The Hashemites Unite Arabia"
 irq.15.d: "A new Kingdom of Arabia has been established by the Hashemite Dynasty. This is the first time in centuries that such a major powerful and unified Arab state exists again. This event will have not only major consequences for the region, but the whole world. It remains to be seen whether this New Arab Nation will stay neutral or side with one of the other major world powers. One thing is certain however, the Middle East will never be the same again after this."
 irq.15.a: "The Islamic World Resurgent?"
 irq.16.t: "The Rashid Ali Presidency"
 irq.16.d: "Iraq has fallen into the hands of many conquerors throughout history, and the last time it was ruled by natives was in the Neo-Babylonian Period. Let us rejoice, O sons of the Two Rivers, for today, an 'Iraqi leader, a Guider, the Honourable Rashid Ali al-Gaylani, has come, to guide Iraq to its §Rlong, lost, and forgotten glory§R."
 irq.16.a: "For Iraq, Cradle of all Nations."
 irq.17.t: "Syndicalization for Iraq!"
 irq.17.d: "Ever since the conquest of Iraq by the putrid Turks, our land has been under thieving Mamelukes, clergy, and powerful tribal leaders, who essentially created a feudal system, in which 90% of the population worked on agricultural fields. The solutions brought fourth by that Hejazi fraud was to simply ally with the landowners, and keep the status quo. He had not a care in the world for Iraq, instead, he cared only for his 'Arab Nation'. The solution to this problem--this land problem--is total reform, through the process of syndicalisation. We shall form Syndicates from tribes, seize land, and reform the land of the Two Rivers. "
 irq.17.a: "The Perfect Plan"
 irq.18.t: "The Dulaym Solution"
 irq.18.a: "Another grain in the sand.."
 irq.18.d: "The Dulaym are the largest tribe in Iraq, hailing fron Najd, and migrating in the 1700s after Ottoman immigration efforts. Now, they are but a thorn in our side, preventing progress, and supporting that damned Saadoun pansy-boy. All of Anbar is under their control, whether it be through officials, or the land ownership. It is time we dismantle their hegemony and move in southern Shi'ite tribes into Anbar, to prevent Dulaym--or something like it, to come and haunt us."
 irq.19.t: "The Sword that cannot bend."
 irq.19.d: "A State cannot exist without its army; the very essence of nature is through struggle or submission, and we will not fall to the latter, nay, we will rise! We shall rise like Emperors of the Four Corners, like our ancestors of Old! We must reform the Iraqi Army and transform it into a professional fighting force worthy of exerting Iraqs authority over its petty neighbours, who for so long abused us. But one question lays, what path in force shall we go?"
 irq.19.a: "Punish the Wicked!"
 irq.19.b: "Protect the Two Rivers!"
 irq.20.t: "Basking in the glory of the Tower!"
 irq.20.d: "Our ancestors, in pursuit of power, attempted to reach for the heavens themselves through the infamous Tower of Babylon. This warrior spirit thus has remained within our blood for all of existence, from the time of Gilgamesh, to Nebuchadnezzar, Alexander, the Sassanids, and the Mongols. We are a folk that does not yield, we are a folk that cannot be destroyed! By our glory and grace will the world be shaped; Our Blood, the most divine of Blood, will henceforth raise itself atop the children of Adam and secure itself oncemore as the Sublime Lords of Humanity!"
 irq.20.a: "For our folk!"
 irq.22.t: "The Euphrates"
 irq.22.d: "The Euphrates remains as one of two bloodlines for Iraq, creating this heavenly garden and seperating us from the desert. It is the very essence of Iraq, and upon it died various martyrs, including the Arch-Saint of Iraq itself, al-Husayn son of Ali, who remains a symbol of courage and sacrifice; a pure manifestation of the Iraqi spirit! Let us not forego our great river, for it is integral to our identity as Iraqis!"
 irq.22.a: "The Country between two rivers.."
 irq.23.t: "Rebuilding the Holy Shrines"
 irq.23.d: "Iraq has remained an integral part of the Shi'ite identity, containing the very resting places of many of their Holy Imams. However, decades of neglect, war, and instability have left these sacred sites in disrepair. With our newfound stability, efforts have begun to restore these shrines to their former glory, ensuring that they remain a beacon of faith and resilience for generations to come. Pilgrims from across the Shi'ite world will once again be able to visit these holy places without fear, strengthening Iraqs spiritual and cultural significance."
 irq.23.a: "For the Iraq of Husayn!"
 irq.24.t: "The Fourteen Tamouz Revolution"
 irq.24.d: "Fiery news comes from Baghdad today, as the official legislative body of the new fledgling democracy; the Majlis al-Shura, has been stormed and seized by reactionary Clerics, Workers, Soldiers, and affiliates with the ruling National-Syndicalist party. This putsch has cemented the permanent rule of Rashid Ali al-Gaylani and his bloc of National-Syndicalists, dismantling the democratic system and tearing away at the recently formed constitution, which was designed to prevent any forms of authoritarian rule in Iraq. Now, Iraq has the opportunity to reassert itself back under the world stage under its new Nationalistic regime. Only time will tell what lays for Iraq and the Middle east."
 irq.24.a: "The Dawn of Liberation has come!"
 irq.25.t: "Iraq Demands Integration"
 irq.26.t: "Iraq Under a Hashemite"
 irq.26.d: "Iraq has emerged from the fires of instability with the Kings authority firmly cemented. With opposition crushed and governance secured, the time has come to shift focus from struggle to stability. The permanent Monarchy now turns its gaze toward economic reform, industrial expansion, and modernization, ensuring that Iraq does not merely survive—but thrives. Efforts to rebuild infrastructure, centralize industry, and harness the nation's vast resources have begun, promising a future of prosperity. The question remains: will this new Iraq achieve true stability, or will its ambitions lead to unforeseen consequences?"
 irq.26.a: "The Hejazite Prince!"
