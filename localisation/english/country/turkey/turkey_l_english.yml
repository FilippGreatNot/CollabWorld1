 POLITICS_MiHRAN_DAMADIAN_DESC: "An Educated Fellow and a large pro-armenian activit, Mihran was born, curiously, in the armenian sectors of the city of Konstantinyye, now populated by allied peacekeepers. He taught in the western armenian town of Sassoun, from where, along with others, he lead the Sassoun Rebellion, which was vehemently crushed, but it is what was just a spark in his career to liberate the armenian peoples from Turkish oppression. He now finds himself supported by the french to do that exact task he has set himself to do."

 POLITICS_SARGIS_TOROSYAN_DESC: "Once a proud ottoman officer, Sargis had his feelings turned around when the governor of Kayseri ordered his family to be massacred, and when he witnessed a relative die in his arms, that was when he vowed for vengeance against the ottomans, and defected to the entente as a valuable army captain. And thus with the support of the french he gradually overcame numerous challenges and secured almost complete control over his home region. However, there are still many challenges he has to face, as the multicultural hotspot, and as a large refugee camp for those affected in the genocides, the people within fear a new turkish offensive that would ultimately destroy them. The fate of the many Armenians, Arabs and Assyrians that hide within this rare gem lie in his arms."
