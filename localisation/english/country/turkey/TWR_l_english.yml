 TWR_low_popular_support: "Low Popular Support"
 TWR_low_popular_support_desc: "We aren't receiving that much support from Turkish citizens. They think our views are dangerous to society. Especially the more conservative parts of society are proving to be quite resistant to socialism and are calling us atheist disbelievers."
 TWR_socialist_militia_system: "Socialist Militia System"
 TWR_socialist_militia_system_desc: "Our defense, unlike the other warlords, is not yet based on a united military force. Instead, we have multiple socialist militias defending Trabzon from the various threats coming to us. This makes us able to recruit more people in our cornered situation, but also makes us slightly more disorganized than if we had a proper military force."
 TWR_support_of_the_georgian_communists: "Support of the Georgian Communists"
 TWR_support_of_the_georgian_communists_desc: "The Communist Party in Georgia is supporting us with funding and resources to secure the revolutions grip on Trabzon. In return, they ask for us to help them in their own fight against the Georgian government. Its a mutual cooperation effort."
