 TUR_turkeys_saviour_in_a_coma: "Turkey's Saviour in a Coma"
 TUR_turkeys_saviour_in_a_coma_desc: "With Mustafa Kemal Pasha being hit by a greek artillery shell while on his horse, he has fallen into a comatose state. The Grand Assembly has temporarily taken charge, but their leadership is weak. We won't be the same without Kemal, and we've been left vulnerable. The Offensive against Greece has halted, and the coalition has ended."
 TUR_ongoing_war_tax: "Ongoing War Tax"
 TUR_ongoing_war_tax_desc: "During the independence war, it was neccesary to maintain a war tax in order to be able to fund the war of liberation. However, the system is taking an ever more increasing toll on our economy. We need to either abolish it or reform it soon, which will be hard with the situation on the front."
 TUR_the_inonu_cakmak_divide: "The Ismet-Fevzi Divide"
 TUR_the_inonu_cakmak_divide_desc: "With Kemal Pasha in a coma, we effectively have two leaders. İsmet Pasha and Fevzi Pasha. Both of them have differing views on the way to go forward, so this is proving to be quite a headache for the now ever more polarized grand assembly."
