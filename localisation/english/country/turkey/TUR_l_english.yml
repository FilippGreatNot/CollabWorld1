 TUR_turkeys_saviour_in_a_coma: "Turkey's Saviour in a Coma"
 TUR_turkeys_saviour_in_a_coma_desc: "With Mustafa Kemal Pasha being hit by a greek artillery shell while on his horse, he has fallen into a comatose state. The Grand Assembly has temporarily taken charge, but their leadership is weak. We won't be the same without Kemal, and we've been left vulnerable. The Offensive against Greece has halted, and the coalition has ended."
 TUR_ongoing_war_tax: "Ongoing War Tax"
 TUR_ongoing_war_tax_desc: "During the independence war, it was neccesary to maintain a war tax in order to be able to fund the war of liberation. However, the system is taking an ever more increasing toll on our economy. We need to either abolish it or reform it soon, which will be hard with the situation on the front."
 TUR_the_inonu_cakmak_divide: "The Ismet-Fevzi Divide"
 TUR_the_inonu_cakmak_divide_desc: "With Kemal Pasha in a coma, we effectively have two leaders. İsmet Pasha and Fevzi Pasha. Both of them have differing views on the way to go forward, so this is proving to be quite a headache for the now ever more polarized grand assembly."

 tur.1.t: "The Legacy of Kemal Pasha"
 tur.1.d: "In the last few decades, the Ottoman Empire has been actively led into a disaster by the incompetent sultans and later on the ittihadists. At the ruins of the Ottoman Empire arose a New Turkey led by none other than the extremely intelligent Mustafa Kemal Pasha. He led us to victory against the powers of Sevres. We were about to win our independence war during the Great Offensive against Greece, but disaster struck! Kemal Pasha was hit by a Greek artillery shell while charging on his horse. While the event wasn't fatal, the pasha lost an eye, a finger and fell into a deep coma. Doctors doubt he will ever wake up from it. Now, the grand assembly leads the nation. Disloyal parts of the country have betrayed our movement and have declared their own little domains. Now, midnight has set upon Turkey- but the sun shall always rise again!"
 tur.1.a: "We will follow his footsteps!"
 tur.2.t: "Grand Assembly Session Begins"
 tur.2.d: "The Grand Assembly is convening today to decide which measures will be neccesary in order to save Turkey from its current crisis. There is a relatively large debate about where most of the available funding should go. One faction is proposing to spend the extra funds on the military, allowing us to get some new guns and new soldiers for the army. The opposition to this idea is saying that we need to spend the money to relieve the people and regain the trust. The last group, made up of economists, proposes to spend the money to invest in the Turkish Industry in order to revitalize the economy. Which group will win?"
 tur.2.a: "Fund the Army"
 tur.2.b: "Relieve the People!"
 tur.2.c: "Invest in the Industry"
 tur.3.t: "Choosing a Leader"
 tur.3.d: "After months of useless debates in the assembly and soldifying the control of the movement in Ankara and Kastamonu, we've goten to the point where we have to pick a new leader. Kemal Pasha hasn't woken up from his coma and is unlikely to do so. Therefore, for now, we need someone else. The two options are Ismet and Fevzi Pasha, both very different individuals at their core. Ismet Pasha is very secular and wants many reforms to get Turkey ready for the new age, while Fevzi believes radical military measures are neccesary to ensure Turkey's sovereignity. We have to pick one man, and the other will definitely be angered by our choice."
 tur.3.a: "Ismet Pasha!"
 tur.3.b: "Fevzi Pasha!"
 tur.4.t: "Government in Ankara Demands our Annexation!"
 tur.4.d: "The central government in Ankara has asked us to be annexed back into the movement fully and not have any autonomy. What should we do?"
 tur.4.a: "We must oblige"
 tur.4.b: "We have other plans!"
