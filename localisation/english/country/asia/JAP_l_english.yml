 japflavour.1.t: "Great Kantō earthquake"
 japflavour.1.d: "A flurry of fear is bestowed upon the Japanese nation, as, within its great capital, Tokyo, there had been a tragic disaster; An earthquake. Numbering 7.9 on the Richter scale, it is one of the largest Japan has ever fought, and it has devastated both the inner city, with the destruction of the Ryōunkaku in the Asakusa district, but also the cities around it, and the countryside. Local folks have rumoured that many of the ill effects were caused by the Korean migrants settled there."
 japflavour.1.a: "That's one way to end the summer months"
