 ALT_BOOKMARK_DESC: "Ashan, a pocket of bolshevism, hidden away at the Western edge of China, is an unstable self proclaimed 'Soviet Republic', Roughly following the principles of Karl Marx, Friederich Engels and Vladimir Lenin, with its own unique twist on the ideology. It lies on the crossroads of two empires, the one of the former Qing, and the one of the former Tsar. But Ashan has its own ambitions, its own goals it wishes to reach, conquest before being conquered, and Governor Gordienko has just the Plan..."

 ALT_mend_the_economic_abyss: "Mend the Economic Abyss"
 ALT_mend_the_economic_abyss_desc: "Our Industry is practically non-existant; Mere months of recent conflict has resulted in the local economy receding to Xinhai times, and the fact that we occupy only a mild portion of Xinjiang does not fare us any better. It is time we invest into some Factories that will help us move away from the volatile Agricultural sector."

 ALT_modest_education_reform_desc: "Without a proper, sophisticated Education system, we will end up with many people moving away to find better education and jobs, but with our current state, any migration, even if it is just 2% of the population, is unaffordable.

We, at the ends of China, at the beginnings of Central Asia, will persevere, no matter the challenge! Before we can even think of reunifying China, we must focus on our small corner of Asia by reforming Xinjiang. We have already begun the process of revolution through our revolt. The road will not be easy or short, but if anyone is fit to pull it off, it is the people of Ashan. We are no strangers to the challenging terrain and constant hardship, and the harder we try, the easier it will be! So what are you waiting for? Grab your guns and fight for China!"
 ALT_the_final_push: "The Final Push"
 ALT_the_final_push_desc: "It is time to end what needed to end long ago; Peiyuan's regime. Our revolt has meant that his control has essentially dissolved, but now it is time to deal the final blow to his treacherous rule. We are close, we just need one final push to finish this war. If we are to reclaim our home, we must first prove we are masters of it. With the numbers being in our favor, one last all or nothing push will determine the fate of Xinjiang forever as we prove why we survive the collapsing world we have found ourselves in."
 ALT_the_secret_force: "Rally the People"
 ALT_the_secret_force_desc: "Our armies are strong, no questions asked about that. However, our population is small, preventing any future growth. We have had to make serving a requirement just to have enough soldiers to fight the Dzungarians. By rallying the people of all sides against our opponents, we can squeeze even more manpower to reclaim our home as well as sow discontent among the enemy lines. It may not be an army, but they will prove invaluable in the struggle to come."

 ALT_bring_bolshevism_to_the_dzungar_people_desc: "Historically, the Dzungar people have not been treated well. When defeated by the Qing dynasty, they were subjected to a massacre that nearly wiped them and their existence from history. Is it any wonder then that they distrust us? We must prove ourselves to them that we are different from their Qing oppressors. We will teach them the ways of Bolshevism and assure them that their way of life and culture will be preserved and that we only want what’s best for our fellow frontiersmen. They will see the rest of the scattered peoples being oppressed and realize they now have a duty to free those just like them."

 ALT_through_ili_we_go: "Through Rivers and Mountains"
 ALT_through_ili_we_go_desc: "Likely our most difficult opponent, we will set our sights on Tianshan. The difficulty here comes not from their sheer power, but from the terrain and size. Xinjiang in general has rough terrain, but Tianshan has size on its size. We will have to occupy both their population, and their mountains and deserts. Nonetheless, we must push forward for the sake of the people of Xinjiang. Not to mention, they have relatively large amounts of iron, something we are in constantly short supply of. Once this is done, the rest of the work will be easy by comparison. It is only a matter of time before the deceptive Ma warlord in Kashgar will take an opportunity to strike us, and with his large army, it will be hard to hold him off. Traveling through the mountains to get to his cities will be of a great difficulty but at least we'll have the advantage of higher ground."
 ALT_fix_the_backwaters_of_the_south: "Fix the Backwaters of the South"
 ALT_fix_the_backwaters_of_the_south_desc: "The southern parts of Tianshan are underdeveloped and poor compared to the north. Even during the conflict, there were villages who welcomed us as liberators in hopes that we would treat them better. Our whole crusade was for the workers of Xinjiang, and here they are welcoming us with open arms. With this opportunity gift wrapped for us, we would be fools among fools to not use this. They have empty land prime for using and a population eager to find work."
 ALT_raise_the_support_of_the_local_farmers: "Raise the Support of the Local Farmers"
 ALT_raise_the_support_of_the_local_farmers_desc: "With how big Tianshan is, we will not be able to just waltz into a big city and immediately expect compliance. We will instead turn back to our roots and bolster the workers to rise up. The rough terrain in Xinjiang has always made farming difficult, leading to low food supplies after the supplies. By helping them feed their families, they will be much easier to integrate. Once the primary food producers are loyal, the rest will follow suit."
 ALT_stamp_out_hui_influence: "Stamp out Hui Influence"
 ALT_stamp_out_hui_influence_desc: "Though the majority of the state has been integrated, their elite and remains of their leadership are defiant. Their guerilla raids have been a nuisance in our attempts to integrate their lands. If the leadership wishes to put their people in the line of fire just to slow us down, it is a sacrifice we must make. Though this will anger the people in the short term, it is a good thing history is written by the winners."
 ALT_take_out_the_khan: "Take out the Khan"
 ALT_take_out_the_khan_desc: "Compared to the rest of our opponents, Kumul may as well be a child standing up to his elders. Still, they are a part of Xinjiang and therefore belong to us. Plus, despite the insults, they will prove useful in the conquests to come. This is just another stop on the world revolution, so march forward men, our comrades must be liberated."
 ALT_found_local_councils_in_hami: "Found local councils in Hami"
 ALT_found_local_councils_in_hami_desc: "Despite their small size, the resistance they put up is quite admirable. While we could violently suppress them until they comply, that would make us no better than the Qing. Plus, that would strain our limited resources more than they already are. All that is needed is simply to shift around some positions and grant some temporary autonomy to them, on a tight leash of course. Their former Kumul identity will slowly shift away into one more compatible with our ideals. They simply need a little more time to see our system for what it is."
 ALT_invigorate_economic_dependence: "Invigorate Economic Dependance"
 ALT_invigorate_economic_dependence_desc: "One way we ensure the new states loyalty is some subtle economic warfare. By investing in their non-existent infrastructure, they will become hopelessly reliant on us for any future development. With enough time and work, they will get to the point of having no choice but to join us or risk economic and societal collapse. It shouldn’t be too hard, their small territory means little needs to be done in order to double their current output."
 ALT_discredit_and_destroy: "Discredit and Destroy"
 ALT_discredit_and_destroy_desc: "Though we wish to not resort to violence on our countrymen, there are those in Hami who do. After sending in the secret police, we were fortunately able to locate those responsible for the Kumul resistance. Fortunately for us, it seems they are a small group despite how well they have done so far. All it would take is one well coordinated strike and we would never hear from these rebels again. In addition, it would serve as a step to integrating the people of Kumul. We will take out those responsible for the citizens of Hami living in fear of bombings and earn their trust."
 ALT_revise_the_hami_administration: "Revise the Hami Administration"
 ALT_revise_the_hami_administration_desc: "Now that the rest of Xinjiang is integrated, we can settle the Kumul issue once and for all. We have the resources to ensure that any remaining resistance is quietly shifted from relevance. All that is left to do is revise the administration to have a more friendly government who is willing to be integrated. It took longer than we expected, but at least our people can finally rest without being afraid of their neighbors."
 ALT_dagger_through_dihua: "End the despotic regime of Dihua"
 ALT_dagger_through_dihua_desc: "We have numerous territories to get through in order to reunite Xinjiang. However, there is a Dihua shaped wall blocking us from moving further. Kumul is literally behind them, and while we have a border with Tianshan, it is too small and river filled to take advantage of. Unlike us, the Dihua Clique isn’t even united and thus has to dedicate some of their slim resources to secure it. Not only that, they have some small Iron deposits which will be nice for now. Every small resource we can get our hands on may as well be a messiah."
 ALT_the_red_spirit_of_the_people: "The Red Spirit of the People"
 ALT_the_red_spirit_of_the_people_desc: "If we are to tame Dihua, we must win the hearts and minds of the people. They claim to be a democracy, that they speak for the people, yet we know better. The province of Barkol was being neglected and its people left to starve. By providing aid to the locals, we can show them we genuinely care unlike the previous regime in Urumqi. By tempting them to our side, we can gain insight into the surrounding regions since information is always useful. In addition, this is where the small Iron deposit is, which is vital with our limited supplies"
 ALT_villainise_the_clique: "Villainise the Clique"
 ALT_villainise_the_clique_desc: "Though the clique promised stability and peace to its people, we know this is not the case. The people have been brainwashed to believe a lie while experiencing terror. We must open their eyes by exposing the clique for the nightmarish dystopia it was. Once the people have their eyes opened, we can establish loyalists in local government which will handle the rest from there. We will need this front if we are to expand further, and a loyal populace will be instrumental to this cause."
 ALT_brush_out_yang_zengxins_face: "Erase Yang Zengxin's remaining influence"
 ALT_brush_out_yang_zengxins_face_desc: "Our efforts so far have secured us most of Dihua, but there are still defiant factors. It seems drastic measures must be taken to end this fiasco one and all. We will brush out Zengxin’s face, remove his name from books. He will never have existed at all if we have anything to say about it. The Zengxin loyalists will be outraged by this, but they are no threat in the long term. By improving the peoples lives, peer pressure will keep them quiet."
 ALT_establish_a_soviet_republic: "Establish a Soviet Republic"
 ALT_establish_a_soviet_republic_desc: "During the Great War, the people of Petrograd rose up and showed what the workers of the world are capable of. Ever since then, we have followed in their footsteps to spread the revolution in our corner of Asia. This is only the beginning. As the red movement blossoms in Xinjiang, we must prepare to spread it to the rest of China. Only when the world's largest population is free can we say we are done."

 ALT_the_state_constitution_desc: "As we prepare for our next steps, we have one clear thing that needs to be done. We will finally integrate Kumul once and for all. To celebrate this long overdue occasion, we will write a constitution guaranteeing equality for all ethnicities of our state. In addition, we will finally return home. Ashandao has served us well, but our home lies in Urumqi. With this last step, we step on to the stage of the world revolution not as a small state on the fringe, but as a respectable power capable of leading the charge."

While they do not necessarily control much Chinese land themselves they do govern over a substantial area in Mongolia, hereby called the Russian Mongol Administration or shortened to as the RMA.
