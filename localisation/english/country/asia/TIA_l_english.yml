 POLITICS_MA_SHAOWU_DESC: "I have served the Government of China for many years, first the Emperor, and after that the Republican Government at Nanking. \n\nI have always tried to do my best; but I must have committed errors though I do not know what they were or this misfortune would not have befallen me. I have lost face."
 POLITICS_SABIT_DAMOLLA_DESC: "The Tungans, more than the Han, are the enemy of our people. Today our people are already free from the oppression of the Han, but still continue under Tungan subjugation. We must still fear the Han, but cannot not fear the Tungans also. The reason we must be careful to guard against the Tungans, we must intensely oppose, cannot afford to be polite. Since the Tungans have compelled us, we must be this way. \n\nYellow Han people have not the slightest thing to do with Eastern Turkestan. Black Tungans also do not have this connection. Eastern Turkestan belongs to the people of Eastern Turkestan. There is no need for foreigners to come be our fathers and mothers...From now on we do not need to use foreigners language, or their names, their customs, habits, attitudes, written language, etc. We must also overthrow and drive foreigners from our boundaries forever.\n\nLong live Eastern Turkestan!"
