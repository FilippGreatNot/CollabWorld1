 POLITICS_MA_SHAOWU_DESC: "I have served the Government of China for many years, first the Emperor, and after that the Republican Government at Nanking. \n\nI have always tried to do my best; but I must have committed errors though I do not know what they were or this misfortune would not have befallen me. I have lost face."
 POLITICS_SABIT_DAMOLLA_DESC: "The Tungans, more than the Han, are the enemy of our people. Today our people are already free from the oppression of the Han, but still continue under Tungan subjugation. We must still fear the Han, but cannot not fear the Tungans also. The reason we must be careful to guard against the Tungans, we must intensely oppose, cannot afford to be polite. Since the Tungans have compelled us, we must be this way. \n\nYellow Han people have not the slightest thing to do with Eastern Turkestan. Black Tungans also do not have this connection. Eastern Turkestan belongs to the people of Eastern Turkestan. There is no need for foreigners to come be our fathers and mothers...From now on we do not need to use foreigners language, or their names, their customs, habits, attitudes, written language, etc. We must also overthrow and drive foreigners from our boundaries forever.\n\nLong live Eastern Turkestan!"

 ### EVENTS ###

 tia.1.t: "The Khotan Ma Clique Demands Khovd"
 tia.1.d: "The Ma state of Xinjiang, or otherwise named Khotan after its powerbase there, has demanded that we cede control over the border territory of the Khovd. Of course, being such an underpopulated piece of territory, with almost no resources, it is of no use to us, but if we give that territory away for little benefit it might capsize the trust that any of our people have left."
 tia.1.a: "We don't care, Khovd can go to Khotan"
 tia.1.b: "Best protect our own interests"
 tia.2.t: "Khotan wishes to join our sphere"
 tia.2.d: "The Khotan Ma Clique has expressed their interest into joining our common defensive alliance with the other Ma cliques, luckily for us, it has been sent by a somewhat neutral nation and has no intention of harming us in any way. Should we accept this friendly call to arms?"
 tia.2.a: "Brothers at hand, brothers at arms!"
 tia.2.b: "We have something else on our minds"
 tia.3.t: "Gansu has betrayed us!"
 tia.3.d: "Our friendly call to an alliance with the other Mas has been duly rejected, this comes as an absolute shock to many of our ministers, who assumed that that the two entities could essentially be classed as one. But this level of integration is not to be, and our split has been exacerbated by their outrageous reply, there is only one thing to do now."
 tia.3.a: "Soldiers, onwards!"
