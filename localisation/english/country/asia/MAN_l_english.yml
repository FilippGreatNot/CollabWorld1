 ## Events

 man.1.t: "The Year of the Dog"
 man.1.d: "The past year has not been to kind to us; the rival faction of the Jilin clique has split off from us, a pro-qing rebellion has sparked in our south and even the Russians got involved in the untamed provinces of Heilongjiang. It is truly a difficult time for us, but for now, we will take out the fireworks in celebration of the new year."
 man.1.a: "Let's hope it ends better than the last"
 man.2.t: "Picking Our Preferred Doctrine"
 man.2.d: "A pretty big cause of all of our recent losses is due to issues in the Army, more particularly, in our general's conflicting strategies regarding warfare. While having a system of adaptability isn't bad, it can just sometimes cause problems, especially when conducting an attack within a great battle. We need to iron out our preferred tactics by officialising a state-mandated doctrine. Which one shall it be?"
 man.2.a: "We need to preserve our limited pool of manpower"
 man.2.b: "We need men on the front, desperately!"
 man.3.t: "The matters of our Clique"
 man.3.d: "We have arrived one step closer to repairing our nation. While we may still be disfigured on the world map we have come much closer to full recovery than at the beginning of the year. We should cherish this progress to aspire towards greater goals, and thus the period of rebuilding our position shall begin!"
 man.3.a: "The matters have been peacefully addressed"
 man.3.b: "The progress is too slow and we are yet too small..."
 man.4.t: "Zhang Zuolin Overthrown"
 man.4.d: "Starting today, the Fengtian clique has announced the overthrow of its governor, Zhang Zuolin, after garnering wide unpopularity among his inner circles. The new state is in the process of reforming itself into something new, detaching itself from the Zhang era and changing its stance on reunification."
 man.4.a: "Who must go?"
 man.5.t: "Fengtian demands our immediate annexation!"
 man.5.d: "Blah blah blaH"
 man.5.a: "Why fight a war"
 man.5.b: "The Monarchist restoration shall be preserved!"
 man.6.t: "Fengtian crosses the Rehe border!"
 man.6.d: "The Reformed Fengtian clique, commanded by Zhang Zuolin and his subordinates, have repealed our treaty and marched into the nearby Province of Rehe, of which we control. Many officers are telling us not to act, while others demand an immediate response. The question befalls on Duan Qirui and his cabinet."
 man.6.a: "We will not allow this blatant attempt at expansion happen!"
 man.6.b: "We won't involve ourselves over a few pieces of desert"
 man.7.t: "Second Zhili-Fengtian War"
 man.7.d: "The Fengtian Clique and her allies have rallied around against the Beiyang government to secure the Rehe border region as well as Zhili in defiance of the dominance of the Zhili clique there. This has caused a response by the Zhili clique itself to organise an all-out assault against its rival, causing an outbreak of war. This conflict is truly one of the largest China has experienced in recent years, especially with its relatively calm nature with only localised wars that have ocurred."
 man.7.a: "Round 2"
 man.8.t: "Kwantung deal reaches its conclusion"
 man.8.d: "The leased territory of Kwantung can now finally finally return to chinese control. The Japanese garrison has successfully retreated in its entirety and the Japanese have signed all the paperwork necessary to transfer the territory over to us."
 man.8.a: "Maybe being a Japanese puppet has its benefits"
 man.9.t: "Fengtian offers to buy our Shandong territories"
 man.9.d: "Blah blah blah"
 man.9.a: "Fine, but they will have to give us concessions"
 man.9.b: "We are not interested in giving them more territory"
