  gui.1.t: "New Year!" 
  gui.1.desc: "January 28, 1922. The Chinese New Year is finally here.... Several years have passed since Sun Yat-sen was forced into Guangzhou, from where he cannot advance any further. Several years of suffering, revolutions, and wars have gone by, but Sun remains faithful to his cause. Now he is celebrating his New Year in his office, sipping from a bottle of whiskey. His wife, Qingling, and son, Fo, are in the United States, having left due to the danger of perishing. They  rarely correspond due to the internal strife in China, and the last letter arrived six months ago. As he drinks straight from the neck of the bottle, dark thoughts invade the mind of the statesman. "How is my son? Has he finished his studies? How are they? I heard things are unsettled in the U.S. after Rockefeller's despotism..." — these words wandered like lost souls through his mind... But the gloomy atmosphere was broken by a knock at the door. "Come in," Sun replied in a hoarse voice.Before him stood his loyal friend Wang Jingwei. He was very glad, which was evident from his smile. He held a letter in his hand. Immediately, the ambiance changed for the better! In his joy, Yat-sen even dropped the bottle of whiskey."Hurry! Give it here!" he said.Wang passed the letter, bowed, and with a smile, exited the office. This was it, the letter... He immediately noticed that it was dated from the previous year, but that did not disappoint him in the slightest. The letter itself brought peace to his soul and gave a chance for his frozen heart, hardened by constant wars and crises, to once again find joy for everyone...."
