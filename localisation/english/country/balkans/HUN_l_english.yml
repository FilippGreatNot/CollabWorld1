 hun.1.t: "Blood On The Danube!"
 hun.1.d: "The Red Regime of Bela Kún in Hungary has been under a diplomatic siege from all four of its neighbors for months. Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Austria have decided to establish a coalition to march on Budapest and get rid of the Red regime. Blood has been spilled already with thousands of soldiers dying along the Hungarian border on both sides. The Soviet Government has condemned the sudden invasion, calling it an act of reactionism. France, on the other hand, has welcomed it with open arms and is getting ready to support the pre-emptive invasion of the coalition. One thing is certain though: The Danube burns, brighter than ever."
 hun.1.a: "Let the fire burn brighter..."

 hun.4.t: "Fate of the Korona"
 hun.4.d: "It is much well known that the currency we commonly use, the Korona, is seeing its last lights. It is a coin from the Austrian era that, since independence, has brought us nothing but economic troubles, the most awful miseries to our people, and a shame to our nation. If we are to decide to replace it eventually, the question will be, what will it be replaced by?"
 hun.4.a: "The obvious choice; The Pengő"
 hun.4.b: "Some people agree that it must be the Forint"
 hun.4.c: "The Dunara! Named after our Lifeblood, the Danube!"

 HUN_a_nation_of_magyars_desc: "Our lands have historically been ruled and inhabited by many peoples; The Avars, The Jasz, the Slavs even had a foothold in Pannonia. But its these lands that we now inhabit, originally conquered 1000 years ago before any maps could last."
 
 HUN_issue_food_stamps: "Issue Food Stamps"
 HUN_issue_food_stamps_desc: "It is truly a sad year for the country of ours, we lost the first world war and it broke the dream of a bright future for Hungary,  a rich and wholesome life of a Hungarian and the idea of a greater Hungarian economy. The current currency being the Korona was bad idea, barely any value in comparison to the neighbouring countries, because of the value most of the hungarian people can barely buy bread to live on. The people want to trust the goverment but they know that they can barely do anything. Our plan is going to be slowly rebuild the might of Hungary, starting from issuing food stamps. It will be the first step to getting rid of the Korona and replacing it with something more valuable. May God keep an eye over our country!"
 HUN_collaborate_with_trade_unions: "Collaborate with Trade Unions"
 HUN_collaborate_with_trade_unions_desc: "We are a country built on equality, freedom and belief in future. We cant let any capitalist aristocrat steal from the poor, which is a thing in our dear Hungary. The Trade Unions are often discriminated and ignored here, but we are willing to hear out the public! We will build a new Hungary, a new age of glory, a new form of equality! If the Trade Unions trust us and said everything exactly how they think it is, then it could really help in removing the corruption from our Soviet Republic once and for all, after all, it is the belief in a brighter future that give motivation to keep going..."
