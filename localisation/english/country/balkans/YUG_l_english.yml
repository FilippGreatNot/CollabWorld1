 ### Decisions ###
 YUG_collapse_mechanic: "The Yugoslav Experiment"
 YUG_collapse_mechanic_desc: "Our nation is one which has never existed yet in history. It has been founded as a union of the southern slavic peoples, all of which share a common identity in language and culture. However, our religious differences and our different historical legacies separate us and are threatening to end the Yugoslav Nation. If we were to face significant amounts of instability, the consequences would be extremely severe..."

 ## Starting Tree ##
 YUG_a_broken_kingdom: "A Broken Kingdom"
 YUG_a_broken_kingdom_desc: "With it's independence and territories secured, many citizens of our nation thought that they could finally leave the political crises, violence and bloodshed behind them for a stable future. Yet, even after 4 years since the end of the Great War and the formation of the Kingdom, the people remain divided. A nation truly broken."
 YUG_the_legacy_of_the_uprising: "The Legacy of the Uprising"
 YUG_the_legacy_of_the_uprising_desc: "Filipovic's Red Uprising was an attempt at the creation of a communist, worker's state, the first of it's kind in the Balkans. After several skirmishes and minor battles, Brigadier General Petar Kosic managed to swiftly crush the uprising. Yet, the lingering effects of the insurrection continue to scar our nation and people." 
 YUG_electoral_gridlock: "Electoral Gridlock"
 YUG_electoral_gridlock_desc: "During the tense 1920 parliamentary elections, the impossible happened: a gridlock. The Croatian Peasant Party achieved the same number of votes as their opponent, the Democratic Party. Meanwhile, the Communists gained popularity in the south, using bitter workers and farmers as their main voting bloc. The nation almost fell apart, with the only saving grace being the royal intervention. Even with this so-called 'political ceasefire', the harsh political tension is still felt in the Kingdom."
 YUG_introduce_veteran_pensions: "Introduce Veteran Pensions"
 YUG_introduce_veteran_pensions_desc: "For a while now, pensions for v eterans have been managed by third party organisations working in cooperation with the government. This caused messy situations and pensions not being given out properly or professionally. To finally reverse this, the Ministry of Finance has approved the payment of at least 120,000 forgotten pensions to war veterans and established a new office which will manage future payouts."
 YUG_celebrating_national_unity: "Celebrating National Unity"
 YUG_celebrating_national_unity_desc: "The situation in our country may be grim, violence may be rampant and corruption unescapable- but at least we can sit back, enjoy and celebrate the National Unity Day! God Bless The Kingdom!"

 ### Events ###
 yugo.1.t: "A Broken Nation"
 yugo.1.d: "Four years ago, on December 1, 1918, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed through the unification of the Kingdom of Serbia and the State of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. With high hopes, the citizens of the new kingdom looked forward to what they believed would be a brighter future. However, political crises, violence, and poverty soon plagued this young nation. The Red Uprising, the Illiteracy Crisis, and many other events signaled to the government that it was time to act. If not, well..." 
 yugo.1.a: "A final breaking point would be reached."
 yugo.2.t: "The Red Uprising"
 yugo.2.d: "On December 5. 1920, 3 Yugoslav policemen were attacked by unknown attackers in Skopje. What was thought to be an isolated incident, soon turned out to be a part of the series of attacks that happened that morning in Montenegro, Macedonia and some parts of Kosovo. As news finally reached the government in Belgrade, Filip Filipović was speaking to a crowd of 1,200 workers in Tetovo. On that faithful day, the Red Uprising began. Over the next 2 weeks, heavy fighting would engulf the south of the nation, with at least 4 divisions and 2 police brigades deployed to contain the inssurection. On 15. December, Brigadier General Petar Kosić managed to swiftly surround a large portion of the Partisan army and eliminate it, ending the inssurrection. Despite it being 2 years since the end of the short lived rebellion, partisans still continue to operate in rural areas and cause havoc."
 yugo.2.a: "Someone should do something about this!"
 yugo.3.t: "Ethnic Situation"
 yugo.3.d: "The Balkans have always been known as a powderkeg of different ethnicities and religions, so similiar yet so different. Most people suspected that the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes would collapse due to those differences in its first years. While they weren't right, the ethnic violence and conflict still is prevalent across our fragile kingdom. The majority of the violence comes from the tensions between the Croats and Serbs, with occasional conflict between the Muslim and Orthodox populace in Bosnia. For now, the regency has been barely managing the tensions. If the tensions get out of hand though.."
 yugo.3.a: "So help me God, there will be war."
 yugo.5.t: "The Beginning of the End..."
 yugo.5.d: "There are riots on the streets. Entire villages and towns are under lockdown. The instability Yugoslavia has faced recently has been too much to bear. The army is acting suspicious and the parliament has become rebellious. Many autonomist organizations such as the Yugoslav Muslim Organizations or the many Pro-Croat parties have declared their disdain with the King. The situation is not good at all and it is very likely Yugoslavia will cease to exist..."
 yugo.5.a: "Oh no..."
 yugo.6.t: "Army Deposits Raided"
 yugo.6.d: "During the past night, countless rebel groups have launched raids on the weapon deposits of our glorious army. This is treason, and they will pay for it. Well... will we be able to make them pay? The country is not under our control and we have lost all of our possesions... the situation is looking worse than ever. Our military and our state are both doomed it seems"

 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_I_YUG_DESC: "Alexander I, born on December 16. 1888., into the Karađorđević dynasty, today bears the title 'The Unifier'. Many, however, consider him undeserving of this title due to his many flaws. After taking the throne following his father's death, he has enforced both praised and controversial policies that have continually hurt the popularity of the dynasty. As Yugoslavia delves further into crisis, will Alexander live up to his title as 'Unifier' and save the kingdom? Only time will tell..."

 YUG_consequences_of_the_great_war_desc: "Despite the Great War being over, the scars are still present as each part of Yugoslavia was somewhat or fully involved within the conflict. Serbia lost over a quarter of their population, while Macedonia still remains heavily filled with trenches and minefields left from the Salonika Campaign. Bosnia and Croatia did not fare well either, with the Austro-Hungarian authorities often enacting humiliating and downright cruel methods of controlling the populace. Truly, our nation still suffers from the past."
