 YUG_collapse_mechanic: "The Yugoslav Experiment"
 YUG_collapse_mechanic_desc: "Our nation is one which has never existed yet in history. It has been founded as a union of the southern slavic peoples, all of which share a common identity in language and culture. However, our religious differences and our different historical legacies separate us and are threatening to end the Yugoslav Nation.

 ## Starting Tree ##
 YUG_a_broken_kingdom: "A Broken Kingdom"
 YUG_a_broken_kingdom_desc: "With it's independence and territories secured, many citizens of our nation thought that they could finally leave the political crises, violence and bloodshed behind them for a stable future. Yet, even after 4 years since the end of the Great War and the formation of the Kingdom, the people remain divided. A nation truly broken."
 YUG_the_legacy_of_the_uprising: "The Legacy of the Uprising"
 YUG_the_legacy_of_the_uprising_desc: "Filipovic's Red Uprising was an attempt at the creation of a communist, worker's state, the first of it's kind in the Balkans. After several skirmishes and minor battles, Brigadier General Petar Kosic managed to swiftly crush the uprising. Yet, the lingering effects of the insurrection continue to scar our nation and people." 
 YUG_electoral_gridlock: "Electoral Gridlock"
 YUG_electoral_gridlock_desc: "During the tense 1920 parliamentary elections, the impossible happened: a gridlock. The Croatian Peasant Party achieved the same number of votes as their opponent, the Democratic Party. Meanwhile, the Communists gained popularity in the south, using bitter workers and farmers as their main voting bloc. The nation almost fell apart, with the only saving grace being the royal intervention. Even with this so-called 'political ceasefire', the harsh political tension is still felt in the Kingdom."
 YUG_introduce_veteran_pensions: "Introduce Veteran Pensions"
 YUG_introduce_veteran_pensions_desc: "For a while now, pensions for v eterans have been managed by third party organisations working in cooperation with the government. This caused messy situations and pensions not being given out properly or professionally. To finally reverse this, the Ministry of Finance has approved the payment of at least 120,000 forgotten pensions to war veterans and established a new office which will manage future payouts."
 YUG_celebrating_national_unity: "Celebrating National Unity"
 YUG_celebrating_national_unity_desc: "The situation in our country may be grim, violence may be rampant and corruption unescapable- but at least we can sit back, enjoy and celebrate the National Unity Day! God Bless The Kingdom!"
 YUG_the_ethnic_situation: "The Ethnic Situation"
 YUG_the_ethnic_situation_desc: "The current situation on the countryside is difficult. There is constant violence between different neighboring ethnicities and economic progress is hindered by internal hate. If we are to become a prosperous nation, we will have to deal with these ethnic tensions. Otherwise, a collapse might be inevitable."

 YUG_stimulating_the_economy: "Stimulating the Economy"
 YUG_stimulating_the_economy_desc: "As the Great War has now begun to subside and as recovery initiatives have begun to bear fruit, we must now stimulate our economy so it can properly go out and blossom from the military-oriented economy we have had in the Great War. We will stimulate the economy by advertising to investors about how we will cut taxes specifically for them when they come into the country, thus increasing capital. Stimulating the economy should also begin to subside many of our woes in the Great War, with economic activity and stability paving the way for political stability as the populace is satisfied by low prices via stimulation. We will also curtail some military spending in order to increase our funds to stimulate our economy while also leaving some military spending for international expansion and defense, which is necessary in this age of relative peace in Yugoslavia."
 YUG_forming_rbr: "Forming RBR"
 YUG_farmer_subsidies: "Farmer Subsidies"
 YUG_farmer_subsidies_desc: " Instead of starting industrialization in this day of age, we would rather build up our agricultural base with our excess funds from stimulating our economy by subsidizing farmers. This will increase yield output hopefully by a fair bit, allowing our economy to be stable in this day of age. We will also begin to subsidize local properties that are designated as farmland in order to allow new farms to be set up easier, further increasing agricultural output and effectiveness. These efforts should hopefully bring us economic and agricultural success, as farmer subsidies should keep farmers happy and our agricultural yield growing at a fast rate."
 YUG_intense_mechanisation: "Intense Mechanisation"
 YUG_intense_mechanisation_desc: "As our subsidies begin to reach farmers, it is nigh time to begin mass mechanization and an intense one at best, as in order to increase and more efficiently harness agricultural input and yield for our exports and general trade we must mechanize our equipment on the farmsite. From tractors to farm-related items, we shall replace old-fashioned methods of harvesting crops in favor of gasoline-powered vehicles doing the work for us, which should increase our yield. Combined with our efforts to subsidize farmers, we shall use some of our remaining and trickling funds from our economic stimulation to make intense mechanization possible for the better of our nation."
 YUG_investing_into_motorways: "Investing into Motorways"
 YUG_investing_into_motorways_desc: "As we begin to walk into the 1920s and thus a new time period, there is destined to be a new method of transportation, and this new method of transportation this time is cars. Cars, imported from Western Europe or from Ford’s headquarters in Detroit, need motorways in order to be used, and cars are becoming more and more common for the upper classes of our society and thus by natural progression by some point trickle down to our lower classes. This is why we need to invest into motorways, as cars need motorways in order to properly drive and traverse. Investing into motorways and thus into cars will also lead into a more efficient transporting of goods and thus allows for more trade opportunities, which will come in handy with our efforts to stimulate the economy."
 YUG_developing_fertilizer_factories: "Developing Fertilizer Plants"
 YUG_developing_fertilizer_factories_desc: "As we further advance our agrarian practices and modernize them, we must look forward to how we process our fertilizer, and this leads us into the concept of developing fertilizer plants. Fertilizer plants allow the processing and mass-storing of fertilizer, which will come in handy for our farmers as they mechanize their vehicles, as fertilizer plants will make their jobs a lot less labor intensive and easier. Developing fertilizer plants will also lead into a streamlining of fertilization practices, which will help crops more easily grow and thus increase our agricultural yield as a side effect. We will bring in experts to teach Yugoslav farmers on how to properly build and use fertilizer plants, hopefully bringing one major component of our agriculture to modern standards."
 YUG_agricultural_exports: "Agricultural Exports"
 YUG_agricultural_exports_desc: "As we conclude our reforms to our fertilization procedures and mechanization, we can finally focus on exporting our agricultural goods. After some time, we have become competitive in the markets due to our fertilizer plants maximizing fertilizer efficiency VIA processing fertilizer in bulk and our mechanization reforms allowing for crops to be harvested, grown and planted way more efficiently and faster, allowing us to have a bulk supply of crops. It is thus, that we lift agricultural tariffs on neighbors that we already have tariffs with if our government deems these tariffs useless and to finally lift all unnecessary trade barriers on agriculture to fully focus our gage on agricultural exports."
 YUG_building_up_adriatic_ports: "Building up Adriatic Ports"
 YUG_building_up_adriatic_ports_desc: "In our efforts to stimulate the economy, we have come across a critical problem–our ports being majorly outdated, and thus not able to sustain our massive efforts of economic stimulation, much to the state’s dismay. This is why, starting now, we will build up our Adriatic ports in order to begin to spread our economic stimulation into our Adriatic ports, positioning ourselves to the alternative of trading with the turbulent Italian States, helping our trade in the long run as Adriatic Trade is going to be majorly diverted to us, thus boosting stimulation into our economy from not just our mainland but now into our ports. Hopefully, this will be a contributing factor into our state’s economic success."
 YUG_truck_production: "Truck Production"
 YUG_truck_production_desc: "As we built our motorways and our ports, one thing is missing from the bunch–our trucks. As cars become commonplace so much where there is a need to invest into motorways to simply catch up with commerce trends, we must produce trucks to stay up to date with the times now even militarily as European nations are finally tapping into the potential trucks or cars have militarily because of their versatility and speed on the battlefront. We will produce these trucks by hiring Zastava to create a military truck company, as our trusted partners over there will benefit and contribute to the Yugoslav state with no problems. Of course however, we will still hire European advisors to craft blueprints for us to use in our factories."
 YUG_the_balkan_breadbasket: "The Balkan Breadbasket"
 YUG_the_balkan_breadbasket_desc: "We have done it. We have finally done it. After multiple years of effort before and after stimulating the economy, we have finally made ourselves an agricultural juggernaut. Now, the whole balkan section of the European continent somewhat relies on us directly and indirectly for agricultural needs, as we have supremacy over the whole agricultural market, as we are the biggest nation in the Balkans. We can finally rest our reforms until the situation in europe changes, as we have now achieved what we have been wanting for the last couple of years–pure economic stimulation, starting from farmer’s subsidies to intense mechanization through time."
 YUG_begin_industrialisation: "Beginning Industrialisation"
 YUG_begin_industrialisation_desc: "As the nations around us and the occidental societies in general begin to industrialize, it is time to match their speed and begin industrialization. No longer shall we subsidize farmers from a bygone period, but instead we shall focus all if not most of our economic stimulation on beginning industrialization. From building sophisticated factories to make poor regions rich, to building the blocks towards a fully mechanized farm life for our farmers, beginning industrialization will kickstart initiatives that would not be possible without industrialization in an agrarian society. As our government stimulates the economy, the natural path of our economy is to begin industrialization with the stimulation gained from capital from our economic stimulation."
 YUG_expanding_zastava_facilities: "Expanding Zastava Facilities"
 YUG_expanding_zastava_facilities_desc: "As new weapons and guns begin to circulate around Western Europe and America as common combat items for the common infantry, we must compete with the Western European companies who make these arms in order to fully industrialize our fully fledged state. It is in such cases then, that we expand our Zastava Facilities to begin producing new and modern arms to bolster the defensive capabilities of our dear state. No longer shall we lag behind our Western European counterparts, and no longer will we drag ourselves on par with the disintegrated Italian State arms-wise, we shall become a self-sufficient and armed nation with the best of arms."
 YUG_investing_into_new_tools: "Investing into New Tools"
 YUG_investing_into_new_tools_desc: " As our efforts of beginning industrialization kick off, we must invest into new tools in order to industrialize further. We will invest into Western European or any advanced society’s weapons by purchasing blueprints off of them and offering them contracts into our country in order to build up loyalty with these companies, allowing them to serve in our state for the long term. This incremental process will hopefully put us up to par with the European theatre in terms of equipment, which will help us in any offensive wars or defensive wars that we end up tangling ourselves into."
 YUG_expanding_manufacturing_facilities: "Expanding Manufacturing Facilities"
 YUG_expanding_manufacturing_facilities_desc: "As we begin to invest into new tools, we also need to invest in expanding manufacturing facilities to even produce these new tools en masse as part of industrialization. This is why with excess funds from us stimulating the economy, we shall expand manufacturing facilities in order to make them able to handle the mass production of items that will be implemented soon as part of our industrialization program. Expanding manufacturing facilities will also increase investment into state factories or private owned companies that own factories, thus increasing stimulation into our economy and helping us achieve our goals in the first place for this industrialization."
 YUG_putting_farmers_into_factories: "Putting Farmers into Factories"
 YUG_putting_farmers_into_factories_desc: " As industrialization takes over farmer’s jobs, we must give them somewhere to work, and the place for them to work is our newly created factories. We need workers to sustain our factories in the first place, so why not use the people who lost their jobs in the first place due to our grand scale industrialization–the farmers. These people will prove worthy in our workplace surely, as they act just like any other worker working for a purpose in society–just this time their role in society is going to change drastically. However this is surely the best for our state, right?"
 YUG_increasing_steel_production: "Increasing Steel Production"
 YUG_increasing_steel_production_desc: "As we focus on industrializing our nation, we obviously need steel to mass-produce items as part of our industrialization as it is an essential component of almost every tool or resource that man has created. It is for this reason that we must increase our steel production in steel mines found in steel-rich areas, which will allow us to sustain our steel production and increase it even if other states are in our way because we domestically produce it. Of course, steel gained domestically will allow us to have a reliable stream of steel, which when steel production is increased helps our military be more efficiently armed if for example a steel-rich nation who we trade with declared war on us."
 YUG_the_serbian_rhineland: "The Serbian Rhineland"
 YUG_the_serbian_rhineland_desc: "As we have jointly increased steel production and ammunition, we have created a Serbian Rhineland of sorts, allowing us to self sustain ourselves in terms of steel. This will come in handy during conflicts where our neighbors blockade us from their steel if they are in conflict with us or simply want to take advantage of our weaknesses during war. However, we must think of the effort we have put into this Rhineland of sorts, and we must protect this area with vigilance and uncompromising rigor in order to keep this advantage, as even the Rhineland back in the day in 1910 was vulnerable to French forces. But like the Germans in war, we shall push back our enemies from our sacred steel deposits!"
 YUG_the_balkan_industrial_powerhouse: "The Balkan Industrial Powerhouse"
 YUG_the_balkan_industrial_powerhouse_desc: "After several reforms, we have finally become the balkan industrial powerhouse we have always wanted. While our neighbors in the Balkans are fully backwater, we are not–and we are now on par with our Western European compatriots who we strived to be. No longer will our economy be controlled by foreign corporations, but we will finally be controlled by our own economy with our own stimulation and our own companies. It is looking good and bright economically in Yugoslavia, thanks to our complete industrialization plans."

Narrowly avoiding defeat from Pašić's NRS, the coalition gathered votes from every part of the Kingdom's population: from Croats to Macedonians and from socialists to liberals. Despite this win, many members of the royalty and the ruling majority-Serb government are protesting the elections, seeing them as 'unfair' and alledging that Radić somehow cheated. Despite these circumstances, Radić is now the leader of a unstable nation and a unstable coalition."

 YUG_limit_the_kings_powers_desc: "The King is acting in undemocratic ways and he has become a pinnacle of corruption. We must secretly kick out his goons out of the government and make sure his power to bring about his wanted changes is limited. The government must be democratically elected, he has no say. One day he should be nothing more than a figurehead. Many of our politicians have even questioned whether we should stay a Kingdom, but such changes would be too radical for now."
 YUG_liberalize_the_economy: "Liberalize the Economy"
 YUG_liberalize_the_economy_desc: "Our current economic system is too authoritarian. We must give more power to the individual and rights to businesses and embrace a somewhat laissez faire system of economics. This has been proven to be the way to prosperity, and we will follow it."

 ### Events ###
 yugo.1.t: "A Broken Nation"
 yugo.1.d: "Four years ago, on December 1, 1918, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed through the unification of the Kingdom of Serbia and the State of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. With high hopes, the citizens of the new kingdom looked forward to what they believed would be a brighter future. However, political crises, violence, and poverty soon plagued this young nation. The Red Uprising, the Illiteracy Crisis, and many other events signaled to the government that it was time to act. If not, well..." 
 yugo.1.a: "A final breaking point would be reached."
 yugo.2.t: "The Red Uprising"
 yugo.2.d: "On December 5. 1920, 3 Yugoslav policemen were attacked by unknown attackers in Skopje. What was thought to be an isolated incident, soon turned out to be a part of the series of attacks that happened that morning in Montenegro, Macedonia and some parts of Kosovo. As news finally reached the government in Belgrade, Filip Filipović was speaking to a crowd of 1,200 workers in Tetovo. On that faithful day, the Red Uprising began. Over the next 2 weeks, heavy fighting would engulf the south of the nation, with at least 4 divisions and 2 police brigades deployed to contain the inssurection. On 15. December, Brigadier General Petar Kosić managed to swiftly surround a large portion of the Partisan army and eliminate it, ending the inssurrection. Despite it being 2 years since the end of the short lived rebellion, partisans still continue to operate in rural areas and cause havoc."
 yugo.2.a: "Someone should do something about this!"
 yugo.3.t: "Ethnic Situation"
 yugo.3.d: "The Balkans have always been known as a powderkeg of different ethnicities and religions, so similiar yet so different. Most people suspected that the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes would collapse due to those differences in its first years. While they weren't right, the ethnic violence and conflict still is prevalent across our fragile kingdom. The majority of the violence comes from the tensions between the Croats and Serbs, with occasional conflict between the Muslim and Orthodox populace in Bosnia. For now, the regency has been barely managing the tensions. If the tensions get out of hand though.."

Soon, Yugoslavia might breathe its last breaths."

 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_I_YUG_DESC: "Alexander I, born on December 16. 1888., into the Karađorđević dynasty, today bears the title 'The Unifier'. Many, however, consider him undeserving of this title due to his many flaws. After taking the throne following his father's death, he has enforced both praised and controversial policies that have continually hurt the popularity of the dynasty. As Yugoslavia delves further into crisis, will Alexander live up to his title as 'Unifier' and save the kingdom? Only time will tell..."

Serbia lost over a quarter of their population, while Macedonia still remains heavily filled with trenches and minefields left from the Salonika Campaign. Bosnia and Croatia did not fare well either, with the Austro-Hungarian authorities often enacting humiliating and downright cruel methods of controlling the populace. Truly, our nation still suffers from the past."
