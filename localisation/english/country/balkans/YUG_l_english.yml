It has been founded as a union of the southern slavic peoples, all of which share a common identity in language and culture.

 ## Starting Tree ##
 YUG_a_broken_kingdom: "A Broken Kingdom"
 YUG_a_broken_kingdom_desc: "With it's independence and territories secured, many citizens of our nation thought that they could finally leave the political crises, violence and bloodshed behind them for a stable future. Yet, even after 4 years since the end of the Great War and the formation of the Kingdom, the people remain divided. A nation truly broken."
 YUG_the_legacy_of_the_uprising: "The Legacy of the Uprising"
 YUG_the_legacy_of_the_uprising_desc: "Filipovic's Red Uprising was an attempt at the creation of a communist, worker's state, the first of it's kind in the Balkans. After several skirmishes and minor battles, Brigadier General Petar Kosic managed to swiftly crush the uprising. Yet, the lingering effects of the insurrection continue to scar our nation and people." 
 YUG_electoral_gridlock: "Electoral Gridlock"
 YUG_electoral_gridlock_desc: "During the tense 1920 parliamentary elections, the impossible happened: a gridlock. The Croatian Peasant Party achieved the same number of votes as their opponent, the Democratic Party. Meanwhile, the Communists gained popularity in the south, using bitter workers and farmers as their main voting bloc. The nation almost fell apart, with the only saving grace being the royal intervention. Even with this so-called 'political ceasefire', the harsh political tension is still felt in the Kingdom."
 YUG_introduce_veteran_pensions: "Introduce Veteran Pensions"
 YUG_introduce_veteran_pensions_desc: "For a while now, pensions for v eterans have been managed by third party organisations working in cooperation with the government. This caused messy situations and pensions not being given out properly or professionally. To finally reverse this, the Ministry of Finance has approved the payment of at least 120,000 forgotten pensions to war veterans and established a new office which will manage future payouts."
 YUG_celebrating_national_unity: "Celebrating National Unity"
 YUG_celebrating_national_unity_desc: "The situation in our country may be grim, violence may be rampant and corruption unescapable- but at least we can sit back, enjoy and celebrate the National Unity Day! God Bless The Kingdom!"

 YUG_the_ethnic_situation_desc: "The current situation on the countryside is difficult. There is constant violence between different neighboring ethnicities and economic progress is hindered by internal hate.

 YUG_pasic_wins_desc: "Pašić and the NRS has won the parliamentary elections of 1923! Carrying a large majority, it has gotten most of it's votes from rural regions. Despite the clear majority, Radić's coalition and party itself has protested the results of the election, noting the allegations of 'voter intimidation' across many regions of the Kingdom.

 YUG_the_federal_bloc_wins: "The Federal Bloc Wins!"
 YUG_the_federal_bloc_wins_desc: "Radić and his coalition of many regional and smaller parties have won the parliamentary elections of 1923! Narrowly avoiding defeat from Pašić's NRS, the coalition gathered votes from every part of the Kingdom's population: from Croats to Macedonians and from socialists to liberals. Despite this win, many members of the royalty and the ruling majority-Serb government are protesting the elections, seeing them as 'unfair' and alledging that Radić somehow cheated. Despite these circumstances, Radić is now the leader of a unstable nation and a unstable coalition."
 YUG_cooperate_with_the_ymo: "Cooperate with the Y.M.O"
 YUG_cooperate_with_the_ymo_desc: "The Yugoslav Muslim Organization supported our bid for power in hopes of securing rights for the muslims of Yugoslavia, especially Bosniaks. We must cooperate with them and work with them within the coalition. Their support is crucial in our plans."

 YUG_establish_a_bosnian_banate_desc: "Our ultimate goal is to achieve a federal Yugoslavia representant of all the ethnicities which make up the nation. We must grant the Bosniaks who supported us their own Banovina and appease their needs. That way, their support for us is ensured for decades."
 YUG_root_out_government_corruption: "Root Out Government Corruption"

 YUG_limit_the_kings_powers: "Limit the King's Powers"
 YUG_limit_the_kings_powers_desc: "The King is acting in undemocratic ways and he has become a pinnacle of corruption. We must secretly kick out his goons out of the government and make sure his power to bring about his wanted changes is limited. The government must be democratically elected, he has no say. One day he should be nothing more than a figurehead. Many of our politicians have even questioned whether we should stay a Kingdom, but such changes would be too radical for now."
 YUG_liberalize_the_economy: "Liberalize the Economy"
 YUG_liberalize_the_economy_desc: "Our current economic system is too authoritarian. We must give more power to the individual and rights to businesses and embrace a somewhat laissez faire system of economics. This has been proven to be the way to prosperity, and we will follow it."
 YUG_establish_a_croatian_banate: "Unite a Croatian Banovina"
 YUG_establish_a_croatian_banate_desc: "We need to unite the Croat People in one province rather than have them be split into multiple. This will satisfy their needs and ultimately make the nation more federal."
 YUG_a_union_of_equal_peoples: "A Union of Equal Peoples"
 YUG_a_union_of_equal_peoples_desc: "Our goal is to achieve a Yugoslavia which is united and gives equal rights to all of its constitutional peoples regardless of ethnicity, religion or views.

 YUG_embrace_a_multi_ethnic_structure: "Embrace a Multi-Ethnic Structure"
 YUG_embrace_a_multi_ethnic_structure_desc: "We can't let out army be dominated by a few greedy Serb generals of the Old Guard.

 YUG_a_serb_dominated_general_staff: "A Serb-Dominated General Staff"
 YUG_a_serb_dominated_general_staff_desc: "We can't give the control of the army to the Bosniak Muslims nor to the treacherous Croats just yet. They would betray us the first time they get an opportunity. We must continue the Serb Domination of our general staff and command chain of the army."

 ### Events ###
 yugo.1.t: "A Broken Nation"
 yugo.1.d: "Four years ago, on December 1, 1918, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed through the unification of the Kingdom of Serbia and the State of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. With high hopes, the citizens of the new kingdom looked forward to what they believed would be a brighter future. However, political crises, violence, and poverty soon plagued this young nation. The Red Uprising, the Illiteracy Crisis, and many other events signaled to the government that it was time to act. If not, well..." 
 yugo.1.a: "A final breaking point would be reached."
 yugo.2.t: "The Red Uprising"
 yugo.2.d: "On December 5. 1920, 3 Yugoslav policemen were attacked by unknown attackers in Skopje. What was thought to be an isolated incident, soon turned out to be a part of the series of attacks that happened that morning in Montenegro, Macedonia and some parts of Kosovo. As news finally reached the government in Belgrade, Filip Filipović was speaking to a crowd of 1,200 workers in Tetovo. On that faithful day, the Red Uprising began. Over the next 2 weeks, heavy fighting would engulf the south of the nation, with at least 4 divisions and 2 police brigades deployed to contain the inssurection. On 15. December, Brigadier General Petar Kosić managed to swiftly surround a large portion of the Partisan army and eliminate it, ending the inssurrection. Despite it being 2 years since the end of the short lived rebellion, partisans still continue to operate in rural areas and cause havoc."
 yugo.2.a: "Someone should do something about this!"
 yugo.3.t: "Ethnic Situation"
 yugo.3.d: "The Balkans have always been known as a powderkeg of different ethnicities and religions, so similiar yet so different. Most people suspected that the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes would collapse due to those differences in its first years. While they weren't right, the ethnic violence and conflict still is prevalent across our fragile kingdom. The majority of the violence comes from the tensions between the Croats and Serbs, with occasional conflict between the Muslim and Orthodox populace in Bosnia. For now, the regency has been barely managing the tensions. If the tensions get out of hand though.."
 yugo.3.a: "So help me God, there will be war."
 ## Political Event(s) ##
 yugo.4.t: "Elections incoming!"
 yugo.4.d: "It is March and the elections are soon to occur! The streets of various cities are vibrant, filled with politicians and their supporters alike campaigning in what are the most important parliamentary elections in this young nation's history. Fiery speeches and tense debates fill various bars and cafes and the people impatiently await to vote."
 yugo.4a.a: "Let the best one win!"
 yugo.eventresults.t: "1923 Parliamentary Election"
 yugo.eventresults.d: "The elections are finally happening. The situation in the nation is tense, as people across the kingdom wait impatiently for the results. Police has been deployed in several urban centres to prevent any sort of violence between different party supporters. And with this, the results are released publicly and..."
 yugo.eventresults.1: "Pašić wins!"
 yugo.eventresults.2: "Radić wins!"
 yugo.eventresults.3: "Deadlock! (INCOMPLETE PATH)"
 ## Collapse Events ##
 yugo.5.t: "The Beginning of the End..."
 yugo.5.d: "There are riots on the streets. Entire villages and towns are under lockdown. The instability Yugoslavia has faced recently has been too much to bear. The army is acting suspicious and the parliament has become rebellious. Many autonomist organizations such as the Yugoslav Muslim Organizations or the many Pro-Croat parties have declared their disdain with the King. The situation is not good at all and it is very likely Yugoslavia will cease to exist..."
 yugo.5.a: "Oh no..."
 yugo.6.t: "Army Deposits Raided"
 yugo.6.d: "During the past night, countless rebel groups have launched raids on the weapon deposits of our glorious army. This is treason, and they will pay for it. Well... will we be able to make them pay? The country is not under our control and we have lost all of our possesions... the situation is looking worse than ever. Our military and our state are both doomed it seems"
 yugo.6.a: "Only Cowards Raid in the Night"
 yugo.7.t: "Attempted Assasination on the King"
 yugo.7.d: "A tourist from Albania has attempted to bomb King Alexander's car. The bomb didn't work as intented and the king has only been lightly injured. However, the consequences of this assasination have been terrible. The rebel groups trying to get independence have been bolstered in their actions seeing how weak our current regime is. Soon, Yugoslavia might breathe its last breaths."
 yugo.7.a: "Protect the King!"
 yugo.8.t: "Yugoslav Parliament Dissolved"
 yugo.8.d: "The parliament and all other institutions of Yugoslavia have been dismantled by the army and the king. This is the last attempt of the government to try and ensure stability. The consequences of this have however been counterproductive. The rebel groups, instead of losing their bravery, have been emboldened even further to leave Yugoslavia. The nation is at the brink of civil war, and all it takes is one domino falling for the rest to fall too..."
 yugo.8.a: "This is not good at all..."
 yugo.9.t: "The Slovenes Leave the Kingdom"
 yugo.9.d: "Slovenia has officialy declared its independence and left the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. These are major news. The country is definitely going to collapse now. There is nothing that can be done. The dominoes have been set in full motion. Our experiment has failed, and so has our king and our government."
 yugo.9.b: "There is nothing we can do..."
 yugo.9.a: "For a Free Slovenia!"
 yugo.10.t: "The Croatian Uprisng"
 yugo.10.d: "The traitorous Croats have also decided to test their luck and declare independence from the Kingdom.

 yugo.10.a: "Za Dom Spremni!"
 yugo.10.b: "Croatian scum."
 yugo.11.t: "YMO Cuts all Contacts"
 yugo.11.d: "The Yugoslav Muslim Organization has cut all contacts with the Government in Belgrade. This means Bosnia is independent in all but name now. This is a major loss. Now we only barely control lands east of the Drina. This is a disaster for the country."
 yugo.11.a: "For an Independent Bosnia!"
 yugo.11.b: "These Turks..."
 yugo.12.t: "Bulgaria Seizes Macedonia"
 yugo.12.d: "The Bulgarian Army, seeing our weakness, has marched into Macedonia and declared it as their territory. This is an attack on our sovereignity! Now its not just the rebels backstabbing us, but also the treacherous Bulgarians! We should have fully ended them after the Great War."
 yugo.12.a: "They stabbed us once again..."
 yugo.13.t: "Montenegro Declares Independence"
 yugo.13.d: "The Heir to the Montenegrin Throne has seized charge of the country and is now officialy leading it instead of our king. This is a disaster. Yugoslavia is gone. The only remaining people are the Serbs. Now the regime itself might be doomed to collapse..."
 yugo.13.a: "For Montenegro!"
 yugo.13.b: "Traitors!"
 yugo.14.t: "The Failed Project Called Yugoslavia"
 yugo.14.d: "Yugoslavia has failed. Our long wanted project has been totally destroyed by foreign spies and traitors. We are back to being what we once were: Serbia. But we will not give up on our intention. It is time to build a great prosperous Serbia with its own legacy. Yugoslavia is Dead. Long Live Serbia!"
 yugo.14.a: "Long Live Serbia!"
 yugo.15.t: "Happy Ramadan!"
 yugo.15.d: "Today, Muslims across Yugoslavia are beginning to celebrate the holiday that is Ramadan, whilst it is practiced exclusively by Muslims and their various sects, it is an important reminder that we should be tolerant of those who practice different religions, as well as to help them celebrate what they can."
 yugo.15.a: "Ramadan Mubarak!"
 yugo.16.t: "Day of Vidovdan"
 yugo.16.d: "Vidovdan is a great Serbian national holiday celebrated in June to commemorate the fallen Serbian martyrs of Prince Lazar and his troops during the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. There were many events that happened during Vidovdan since then, like the serbian declaration of war against the ottomans in 1876 or the Assasination of Franz duke Ferdinand in 1914. It is a holiday celebrating national unity, history, heritage as well as solidarity."

 yugo.100.t: "Serbian Backlash"
 yugo.100.d: "The Serbs of the Radical Party have demanded that we pull back our reforms and split the Bosnian Banovina again. They think the Serbs of Bosnia will end up being opressed, but the truth is they just don't want to recognize the existence of the Bosniaks. We could either try to appease them or give these ethnonationalists the middle finger, what should we do?"
 yugo.100.a: "Attempt to Appease Them"
 yugo.100.b: "Bosnia will be Bosnia!"
 yugo.120.t: "A letter from Berlin"
 yugo.120.d: "A letter has arrived from the German ambassador to Yugoslavia demanding the lease of Drava and Prekmurje or severe consequences. Should we risk the threat of invasion or worse or should we give in to their demands and save our countries sovereignity but at the cost of loosing most of slovenia?"

Many, however, consider him undeserving of this title due to his many flaws. After taking the throne following his father's death, he has enforced both praised and controversial policies that have continually hurt the popularity of the dynasty.

Bosnia and Croatia did not fare well either, with the Austro-Hungarian authorities often enacting humiliating and downright cruel methods of controlling the populace.
