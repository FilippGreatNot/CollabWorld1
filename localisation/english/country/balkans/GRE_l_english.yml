 gre.1.t: "Victory...but at what cost"
 gre.1.d: "Our triumph in the Asian Minor campaign have settled our population for only a short period of time. The National Schism has reached a point of no return, with our current government only making everything worse by its questionable victory in the last election. With the King has yet to be seen, and the referendum on keeping the monarchy not being announced, the dissatisfied population has once again reignited the flame of the Schism. Rumors claim that radical groups have formed following these events, that seek to overthrow the current order. And with the police and military refusing to take orders from high Command, word has it that there might be a military conspiracy forming, with a Coup looming over the nation."
 greoption.1.a: "As if it couldn't get any worse..."
 gre.2.t: "Violence in the streets"
 gre.2.d: "-Groups of armed civilians clash between each other almost on a daily bases now. Venizelists and pro-Monarchists, all of whom are Greeks. Families get torn apart due to their disgust to each other. Brothers, sons, fathers, daughters, mothers...all kill each other over own got damn crown...-Adonis was baffled by these events, exclaiming his frustration to his fellow college...Did we really have to get to this point? I mean cant there be some other alternative. Soon there will be a big wave of radicals, from all political ideologies just running around taking advantage of this situation, and who know what that could bring us to..\'\nHis college looked at him with an annoyed look.\n\"-Adoni are you trying to get your ass beat in the middle of the street? Shut the fuck up-...This prick... Adonis thought to himself, he pulled out a leeflet he found on the street earlier out of his pocket. The leaflet was by the NSPG, seeking supporters, he looks at it with interest, but then puts it back in his pocket and goes on with his job."
 greoption.2.a: "Maybe its not a bad idea..."
 gre.3.t: "Parliment up in flames"
 gre.3.d: "at this point of the Schism, there can be no decisions taken in the parliament. There will be never be any sort of agreement between parties the way the crisis has evolved. Every day is just another fight, and every speech just turns the parliament into a zoo of people insulting each other. Multiple politicians have stormed out and the building it self has been left unguarded for weeks, its only a matter of time for some radical to storm in and take power."
 greoption.3.a: "About damn time someone would..."
 gre.4.t: "The general meeting..."
 gre.4.d: "With the protest now at their peak, and the parliament in chaos, acting prime minister Gounaris was left in shambles. As a last ditch effort to negotiate with the protestors. He gathered his advisors and last loyal ministers and held a meeting.In the next few hours of heated debate the council agreed on terms that they would present to the protestors, and with a mass riot happening right outside the parliament, Gounaris addresses the nation on the radio..."
 greoption.4.a: "Now we wait..."
 gre.5.t: "The radio call ..."
 gre.5.d: "Announcement broadcast on radio by Dimitrios Gounaris.\nBroadcast from National Radio in Athens.“My dear Greeks"' Gounaris exclaims in a shaky voice,"This is Dimitrios Gounaris speaking to you. Not only as a servant of your politics. but also the son of this ancient and sacred land. Today I stand before you. Not a politician who is bound by position. But it is Greeks whose hearts ached for our homeland that was on the brink of destruction.The streets echo with cries of division. Brothers vs. Brothers from city to city Our beloved Greece is teetering under the weight of this political division. We stand on the cliff Look into the realm of chaos and destruction. We should lose the dignity of our ancestors. Was the sacrifice of 1821 and the dream of a united Hellas in the flames of discord?I beg you to stop this madness! Look into your heart and remember what it means to be Greek. Our country was built in a crucible of struggle and is bound together by the blood of heroes who gave their lives for freedom and unity. Will we betray their legacy? Will we reduce our beloved homeland to ashes for the sake of political differences?For those who are very angry I ask that the stones and the torches be laid down. I say: To those who cry for revenge: Silence the voice of hate. For those trying to take advantage of this chaos I would like to warn you that the Greeks will not forgive those who try to destroy her from within.I call on King Constantine, the symbol of our unity, to rise up as the father of this nation and guide us through this storm, and I call on all citizens regardless of creed or party. Let's remember above all the debt we owe to Greece.This is a time for dialogue. It's not destruction. For integration, not destruction. We come together as one Greek people and are healed from this wound."The broadcast ends with the last notes of the Greek anthem playing in the background, and finally, the radios once again go silent. "
 greoption.5.a: "Yet, its was too late"
 greoption.5.b: "The people, after a long time, settle"
 gre.6.t: "Greece last Straw"
 gre.6.d: "With Gounaris' failed attempt to calm the people, the nations descends to chaos completely. The parliament non-functional, the economy in ruins, crowds of people in the streets fighting the police and national guard, the military command structure as dysfunctional as it could be. It seems that there is only a glimmer of hope left, perhaps in the people's spirit, however no one has stepped up to stop the chaos since the radio broadcast of Gounaris."
 greoption.6.a: "Radio silence..."
 gre.7.t: "Matrial law"
 gre.7.d: "In the early hours of the day, under the cover of the dark, members of the Athenian Raider Brigade under the command of Nikolaos Plastiras, stormed the Army General Staff buildings at Cholargos and telecommunication centers. The people of Athens were still mostly asleep so no one was aware of what was happening. The Presidential Guard was aware of the situation and was advised not get in the way of the Army. There was no resistance whatsoever, members of the high command located in the General staff buildings gave in to the Raider Brigader's demands to surrender and switch to their side, informing them that there is a coup happening.With telecoms down and the High command under the couper's management, a dispatch of forces of the cavalry and infantry regiment moved to the Parliament. The Presidential guard gave into the forces of the Couers. They proceeded to walk into the empty building, checking every cabinet for members of the parliament, yet they found nothing. The whole building was empty...no one around, and only an eerie atmosphere left by the absence of people. What used to be a roaring parliament of different opinions, intelligent minds, talented spokesmen, all gone due to their own decadence.With only few minutes remaining till dawn, the now awake citizens, not knowing of the Coup, tune in into the Radio, yet the only thing they hear is silence, but then..."
 greoption.7.a: "Let's hear what the king has to say."
 gre.8.t: "The Royal Commandment"
 gre.8.d: "‘’Royal commandment’’- was the first thing heard from the speakers of the radio of every Greek household. The announcement goes on to list the prohibition of several civil rights and the termination of several articles of the constitution.‘’From King Constantin, King of Greeks, and member of the General Staff with consent for the government and the temporary rule over the parliament, commences the termination of articles 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18, 20, 95 and 97 due to the the threats against public order and the safety of the nation from internal dangers.’’The common Greek man sits at edge and does nothing but listen to the broadcast as the announcer continues…‘’Announcement from, King Constantin of Greeks, the military committee, the temporary President Nikolaos Plastiras, the members. Since the new commandment, any form of traffic and or pedestrians, are prohibited to be active after 9pm sharp. At this time, citizens must be in their residence. If any citizen is found dwelling outside their residence, they will be shot without warning…The Sun rises, and so..."
