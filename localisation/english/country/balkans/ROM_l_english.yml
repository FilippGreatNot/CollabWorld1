 ### Ideas ###
 
 ROM_anti_hungarian_sentiment: "Anti-Hungarian Sentiment"
 ROM_anti_hungarian_sentiment_desc: "For the last few years, Hungary has been our main foe in the region and our people have developed a deep hate for them which is both a good and a bad thing as it increases our military readiness in the case of Hungary becoming resurgent but it also increases attacks on Ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania which ultimately destabilizes the nation as a whole."
 ROM_agricultural_backbone: "The Agricultural Backbone"
 ROM_agricultural_backbone_desc: "Our economy is heavily reliant on our farmers to produce crops and export them to our neighbors. If this part of the economy collapsed, we would likely have significant issues. On top of that, the economy being highly based on agriculture is limiting our industry."
 ROM_recovering_armed_forces: "Recovering Armed Forces"
 ROM_recovering_armed_forces_desc: "Our armed forces are slowly recovering from the massive casualties we had in the Great War. It will take time, but we will restore the Romanian Army's might. The mistakes of the Great War will not be repeated ever again."
