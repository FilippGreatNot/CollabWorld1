 INTRO_TEXT__UVS:0 "On a faithful day in 1919, during the ongoing Battle of Paris between the §gGerman Kaiserreich§! and the §2French Republic§!, democratic politicians rose up against the Kaiser and demanded his abdication. The country was thrown into a §Rbrutal civil war§! between §gMonarchist-Nationalist§! and §HRepublican§! forces. \n \n Yet, in the cities, a new movement was growing stronger each day. The §RSpartakusbund§!, led by the revolutionaries §tRosa Luxemburg§! and §OKarl Liebknecht§!, was about to change the fate of Germany. In cities such as Berlin, Leipzig, Hamburg and Stettin the §RSpartacists launched armed uprisings§!, starting a new front in the civil war. The fronts slowly soldified until the decisive Battle of Berlin took place in the late 1921. Failure came however, as the republic succesfuly pushed the §RSpartakusbund§! §gmilitias§! out of the city. Now, the fronts have stalled and we have a temporary ceasefire with the §HRepublicans§!. It is time to prepare to finish the §RSpartacist Revolution§!, once and for all."
 INTRO_TEXT__SOV:0 "For centuries, the §8Russian Realm§! was ruled by arrogant nobles who exploited the people and profited from their labor. The §gTsar Nicholas II§! was a man who, instead of helping the people, tried to seize power for himself and was extremely incompetent in his leadership.\n \nAll of this was about to change. The events of the §tOctober Revolution§! would end up shaping Russia forever. §RVladimir Lenin§! and the rest of the §RRussian Communist Party§! launched a full scale revolt against the §7Russian Republic§! established a year before and gave the workers what they needed. They gave them §Gland§!... they gave them §8bread§!... but §Cpeace§! is not there yet. The §LRussian Civil War§! ended in a terrible stalemate, with many innocent men dying on the frontlines on all sides.\n \nNow, Russia lies in ruins. The §RRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic§! controls Moscow, Petrograd, Tsaritsyn and many other major cities. The §RRevolution§! is still unfinished with white armies still sorrounding it. At the very least, §RMikhail Tukhachevsky§! has suceeded in securing a victory against §PPoland§!. He rules over an ever more autonomous §RPolish-Belarussian Military District§!, the western outpost of our §Rrevolution§!."

In Wilhelmshaven, a major mutiny took place and the §OFree German Syndicates§! were established. To make the situation even worse, the §RSpartakusbund§! also launched an uprising across cities like Berlin, Leipzig, Hamburg and Stettin. For a few months, we've fought a bloody battle against the §RSpartacists§! in the German capital of Berlin. However, to everyone's surprise, we have repelled their attack. Now, the fronts have finally stalled. The §HRepublic§! can heal from its wounds, but it will certainly take time. \n \n Now, an internal crisis is brewing. The tense economic situation and our lessening control across §bGe§!§Rrma§!§Yny§! have led to a high amount of criticism against the §tSPD-led§! government. The christian-democrat §BZentrum§! and the nationalist §gDNVP§! are calling for a snap election in order to stabilize the country. The president §tFriedrich Ebert§! stands at a crossroad. The only question is which way he'll choose."
 INTRO_TEXT__IRQ:0 "Born from the ashes of the §ROttoman Empire§! following the §LGreat War§!, the §8Kingdom of Iraq§! was expected to remain little more than a §tBritish§! client state, its primary role to safeguard §timperial interests§! and fuel the engines of foreign oil companies. However, history took an unexpected turn. With §tBritain's§! retreat from its overseas holdings, Iraq now finds itself standing alone; independent yet fragile, sovereign yet deeply divided. At the helm of this precarious state stands §GKing Faisal I§!, an unpopular ruler imposed by the §R British§!. A §G Hashemite§! from the Arabian Peninsula, §GFaisal§! claims descent from the §7Prophet Muhammad§! and once waged war against the §R Ottomans§! in service of §tBritish ambitions§!. Now, as Monarch of an uneasy kingdom, he struggles to assert legitimacy over a land that views him as an outsider, though his real ambitions lay in the claims of his father; the §GUnification of the Arab Peoples§!, from the §BAtlantic to Indian Oceans§!. But §8Iraq§! is far from united. In May of 1920, a large popular §Rrevolt§! occured, protesting §RBritish§! Authority, in the hopes of achieving an independent §8Iraqi state§!. The §RRevolution§! was unsuccessful, with the §RBritish§! utilizing §Rbrutal§! tactics to quell the uprising. Now, §Rthe Legacy of 1920§! remains ever present, with §GFaisal§! being a symbol of §Rforeign§! authority; an alien §GKing§! with no connection to the §8Land§!.   \n \n Iraq's fate hangs in the balance, with internal parties vying for power. §RThe Hierophant of the Orient remains standing, but the new century shall test its limits§!. The sands of §8Mesopotamia§! shift once more, and with them, the destiny of a nation."
 INTRO_TEXT__FGB:0 "The Free German Brigades, otherwise referred to as The Freikorps, or the Military Administration of Southern Germany, after its failure of capturing Berlin. Is a German Warlord state formed as a result of the Kapp Putsch and its exodus from the Brandenburg Area, to the Catholic-majority areas in the South, from where they have formed a substantial powerbase and maintained their presence since. The Kapp Putsch was an attempt, supported by the DVLP and its allies, to overthrow the German Republic after its failures to supress the Spartacist uprising which has spread to its east. As a result, much of its Prussian territory has been divided by foreign powers seeking to gain more territory and influence, and has been a source of anger and discontent for the Freikorps militias ever since. It is lead by a council of electors who, in the case of an attempted assassination or another coup, are there to put a provisional leader in charge and to mitigate the aftereffects. Its Chancellor is Dr. Wolfgang Kapp, the icon of the Putsch, and second-in-command is the Field Marshal Walther Von Lüttwitz, and, while he may not seem to hold a lot of power, is very influential in terms of the Army and what the Freikorps forces do. To counteract this, Kapp has instituted the more liberal Gustav Noske as his vice-Chancellor, acting as a check against Lüttwitz's power, in case if he ever gets any... ideas. The state is undergoing several crises and underground revolts, especially with its unsustainable administrative model, which upholds wartime policies while barely allowing other institutions to function. \n\nThe Freikorps have several key paths, including going with the reformist Gustav Noske, a coup path for Lüttwitz, a coup path for Hitler post-reunification, and a path for the Stahlhelm, if you so choose to go with Lüttwitz. Pabst and Ehrhardt can be played as well, but their paths are not recommended, and finally there is the Sturmabteilung leader Ernst Röhm, from which you can get other leaders like Anton Drexler and Adam Dressler. \n\nAll paths are to be developed, expanded and finished. If you see missing content, don't worry, it won't be there for long. There is an ongoing GFX effort dedicated to remaking or adding focus icons and spirit icons, and I often try to rebalance certain paths if they may be broken or hard to navigate, and I intend to make each path unique and fun in its own way. This will take long though, and I'll hope you'll stick around with my journey to finish it :) -Chlebek."

However, the Japanese did not want to lose money.Japan occupied Kamchatka and Sakhalin, creating its own puppet states. Using the support of Semenov and Merkulov, the Far Eastern Republic was created. Dieterichs, the Semenovites, and some Mensheviks supported the new government.However, Peter of Vologda did not dare to cooperate with the pro-Japanese forces and eventually separated from the Far Eastern Republic.
