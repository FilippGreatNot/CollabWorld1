The once powerful §gindustrial zones§! of the Ruhr have been ruined by economic crisis and §Rsocialist strikes§!. The §gWehrkommando§!, the direct rule of the Army Command of the §gGerman military§!, holds the power in the region. It is led by §gAugust von Mackensen§!. He is however getting older and older, and some individuals would like to take his throne as the leader of the §gWehrkommando§!.\n \nThere is an ongoing §Rsocialist§! mutiny right now, and the §0Kaiserliche Schutzstaffel§!, the new elite paramilitary division §gMackensen§! is using to supress resistance, is profiting from the situation. They are calling for radical measures and to quell their §tresistance§! by any means neccesary.\n \nBack during the more active phase of the civil war, we worked together with the §8Freikorps§!. However our relations have worsened, and now we are practically enemies in the fight to reunite Germany.\n \n§YThe future will be decided by the bold and the cunning.§!"
