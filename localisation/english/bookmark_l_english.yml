 FRA_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The French Nation is in disarray. Since the failure to break the German hegemony during the Great War, France suffered deep instability, but not as much as Germany. François Coty made a coup and is now the ruler of a tired France who needs to refocus on itself, instead of caring about European politics. With the old government fleeing to North African colonies, the French State is free to push its new policies, aiming to restore France to its former glory."
 SOV_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The October Revolution strands partially triumphant over the White regime of the old Tsar and his band. However, the civil war which plagued the country for a few years ended in a stalemate. The Soviet Union is still at threat of dissolution from the whites the anarchists and the rests of the reactionaries. They must be destroyed in the name of communism."
 UVS_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The Spartacist Revolution in Germany didn`t really work as planned. The Spartakusbund failed to establish full control over Germany but the crisis the country found itself in allowed it to settle in the east. Now it still remains to be seen whether Rosa`s Spartacists can reunify Germany, and whether there will be a new chairman."
