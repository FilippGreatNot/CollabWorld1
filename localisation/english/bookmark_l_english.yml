 FRA_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The French Nation is in disarray. Since the failure to break the German hegemony during the Great War, France suffered deep instability, but not as much as Germany. François Coty made a coup and is now the ruler of a tired France who needs to refocus on itself, instead of caring about European politics. With the old government fleeing to North African colonies, the French State is free to push its new policies, aiming to restore France to its former glory."
