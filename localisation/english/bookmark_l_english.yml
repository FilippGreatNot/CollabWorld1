 UVS_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The Spartacist Revolution in Germany didn`t really work as planned. The Spartakusbund failed to establish full control over Germany but the crisis the country found itself in allowed it to settle in the east. Now it still remains to be seen whether Rosa`s Spartacists can reunify Germany, and whether there will be a new chairman."
 FRA_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The French Nation is in disarray. Since the failure to break the German hegemony during the Great War, France suffered deep instability, but not as much as Germany. François Coty made a coup and is now the ruler of a tired France who needs to refocus on itself, instead of caring about European politics. The French State is free to push its new policies, aiming to restore France to its former glory."
 ARM_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The Armenian Nation stands more threatened than ever. The consequences of the Armenian Genocide orchestrated by Enver Pasha and many other criminals have left Armenia a destroyed, isolated nation. Yet, not all hope is lost. Armenia still clinges on to some of its lands and with the Collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the Armenian Nation might finally be able to get revenge against its enemies."
 YUG_BOOKMARK_DESC: "Yugoslavia has gone through a lot to be united. The Kingdom of Serbia was a driving force for its unification and faced significant losses of population due to the Austro-Hungarian occupation during the Great War. But now that the Habsburg Empire has collapsed and that Europe has a new order, Serbia was able to unite with the Croats, Slovenes and Bosniaks to form a New Kingdom. It will be a union of the Southern Slavic peoples, but will it be able to endure all the ethnic tensions?"
 BAV_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The Bavarian Soviet Republic was established more than 2 years ago during the events of the German Civil War. We have survived the initial fray, but now Bavaria finds itself at the doors of death. The more powerful Freikorps militias are about to march on Munich and Bavaria is instable internally, to the point one might say that it could fall into its very own civil war. The situation is bad. Whoever will lead Bavaria, will surely have a very hard time doing so."
 OTHER_BOOKMARK_DESC: "All else on the map. It probably either has no content, or the content is unplayable."
