 BOOKMARK_BLITZ_DESC: "The Great War took a great toll on the world, lasting 5 years from 1914 to 1919. In the end, no side won and both collapsed into total disarray. Germany collapsed into warlord states, Russia into a long civil war and France got seized by a perfume businessman. The most profit was made by the Corporate Rockefeller, who has been leading the USA for some time now. Radicalism and Revolutions are on the rise across the whole world."
