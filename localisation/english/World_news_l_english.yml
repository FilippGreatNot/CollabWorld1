 WORLDNEWS.13.t: "John D. Rockfeller Assasinated"
 WORLDNEWS.13.d: "President of the United States John. D Rockfeller, also known as the richest man in the world, was assasinated this morning while driving to a business meeting in Atlanta. His driver made a wrong turn into an abandoned street. Unfortunately for the president a disgruntled mine worker, who was also revealed to be a member of a socialist paramilitary, was sitting nearby armed with a gun. When he realized what was happening, he shot right into Rockfellers face. The driver suceeded in escaping the scene and the worker was executed. This event is rather ironic, since the Corporate President recently passed an act reducing mining workers rights. One thing is for certain though: this day will be writen about in the future as the day that changed America forever."
