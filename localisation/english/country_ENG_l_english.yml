 ENG_fullers_britain: "Fuller's New Britain"
 ENG_fullers_britain_desc: "At last, a short time ago, the Great War Hero and wise military general J.F.C Fuller has seized control over the isles. However, this didn't go as planned. The royal family didn't submit to Fuller's rule so they had to go into exile to Canada, or at least that's what they plan to do. Meanwhile, a resistance movement has formed to combat Fuller's regime called His Majesty's Royal Resistance. They do terror attacks all across the country, severely damaging our control. On top of that, we are seeing massive resistance in our colonies and most of our dominions across the world have declared independence. The time has come to seize Britannia's glory back, stronger and more proud than ever."
