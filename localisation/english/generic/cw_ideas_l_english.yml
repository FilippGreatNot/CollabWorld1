 PER_retarded_army:0 "Heavily Incompetent Army"
 PER_retarded_army_desc:0 "[PER.GetName]'s army is filled to the brim with officers who are there just for the sake of being there. The "humiliation wars" saw the country take some of its worst losses in the modern century yet, putting the outdated, inefficient and heavily incompetent [PER.GetAdjective] army out there for all to see.\n\nThe army remains a backwards tribe-like force up to this day, underequipped, undertrained and definitely not suited to fight wars.

 PER_islamic_dynasty_mullahs_desc:0 "The Qajar Dynasty experiences significant influence and manipulation from the Islamic Clergy. The integration of Mullahs into the parliamentary system by the Qajars essentially transferred governmental authority to the clergy. As a result, the clergy now exercise even greater power than the Monarch, actively imposing their socio-religious ideals and hindering any potential modernization efforts."

A country that used to mean something on the world map once has been reduced to nothing more than a backwards tribal country unable to uphold its sovereignty or defend itself. The Qajar dynasty exhibits a profound lack of competence, while an uneducated populace drives the country toward disaster. With no promising future in sight, one can make a good guess how many more years [PER.GetName] can endure into the 20th century."
