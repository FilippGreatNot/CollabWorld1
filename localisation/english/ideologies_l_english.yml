 ### Subideologies ###
 ## bolshevism ##
 marxism_leninism: "Marxism-Leninism"
 marxism_leninism_desc: "Marxism-Leninism is a branch of Marxism developed by Vladimir Lenin and other figures. Unlike classical Marxism, which assumes the possibility of victory only through revolutions in advanced capitalist countries, Marxists-Leninists postulate the possibility of revolutions in underdeveloped countries. Marxism-Leninism also strives to provide a scientific basis, utilizing dialectical and historical materialism, as well as scientific communism." #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 war_socialism: "War Communism"
 war_socialism_desc: "War Communism is a form of government led by the military, emphasizing a militarized, state-controlled society. It blends the ideas of communist governance with military dominance. The goal is to secure military victory of the revolution over reactionism."

 leninist_pragmatism: "Pragmatic Leninism"
 leninist_pragmatism_desc: "Lenin is undoubtedly a great man and leader. However, he is excessively idealistic. For the survival of the socialist state and the achievement of communism, a more realistic and pragmatic approach to politics, economics, and the party is needed. Of course, envy and revisionists accuse us of opportunism, but we know who the real opportunists are and who must pay for their counter-revolutionary actions." #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 national_marxism: "Social Chauvinism"
 national_marxism_desc: "Social Chauvinism is a syncretic ideology that combines socialist elements with ultranationalist ideals, mainly extreme patriotism and exclusionism. Social Chauvinism's social structure is comprised of an in-group and an out-group, which are usually determined by culture, race, or religion. The in-group is treated much like any other member of a socialist state, whereas the out-group is seen as vermin or someone to convert."
 
 integral_socialism: "Integral Socialism"
 
 technocracy: "Technocracy"
 technocracy_desc: "A Technocracy is an ideology combining technocratic governance with socialist principles. This ideology envisions the establishment of a meritocratic government composed of technical specialists while maintaining a planned economy and low levels of social inequality. Technocratic governments often pursue isolationist foreign policies, ranging from total isolation from the outside world to mild isolationism, although they may intervene in the internal affairs of countries they consider antagonistic." 
 
 blanquism: "Blanquism"
 jacobinism: "Jacobinism"
 jacobinism_desc: "Modern Jacobinism is usually associated with extremely violent bolshevik movements which establish socialism through pure tyranny. The real Jacobins had a brutal legacy in the French Revolution. This jacobinism, however, truly seeks to cause a mass upheaval and abolish class warfare through extremely radical, bolshevik policies."
 communist_bismarckism: "Social Bismarckism"
 communist_bismarckism_desc: "Our people can truly be called the engine of history. Unfortunately, they fell victim to betrayal. Betrayal by the bourgeoisie and the ambitions of the generals in the Weltkrieg, the negligence of officers, and the sabotage by ordinary soldiers. However, history moves forward, towards liberation. From now on, the people will not be oppressed; the hand of the proletariat and traditions, in alliance with the faithful hand of the leader, lead us into a new era, an era of prosperity for the German nation and the common man." 
 
 afrosocialism: "Afrosocialism"
 afrosocialism_desc: "Afrosocialism is a political and economic ideology that combines socialist principles with the struggle for Black liberation and self-determination. It emphasizes collective ownership, economic equality, and social justice while addressing the historical impacts of colonialism, capitalism, and systemic oppression. Afrosocialism advocates for policies that empower marginalized communities, promote wealth redistribution, and establish economic systems that serve the needs of the people rather than elites. It is closely tied to anti-imperialism and Pan-Africanism, seeking solidarity among African and Afro-diasporic populations worldwide. Supporters view it as a path toward true liberation, while critics argue that centralized economic control can lead to inefficiency or excessive state power."
 ultraleninism: "Ultra-Leninism"
 esoteric_socialism: "Esoteric Socialism"
 bolshevik_nationalism: "Bolshevik Nationalism"
 bolshevik_nationalism_desc: "This ideology, in its essence, finds its source of ideals in the October Revolution and is greatly inspired by figures such as Vladimir Lenin. However, the movement is not just radically bolshevik but also radically nationalistic, seeking the success of the nation over all else. Other ethnicities or minorities are often opressed and have their rights stripped away. Bolshevik Nationalism is highly Anti-Semitic and often blames Judaism for being Capitalist in its nature. Overall, the ideology is the perfect example of what many political theorists view as the Horseshoe Theory."
 
 ## marxism ##
 marxism_subtype: "Marxism"
 marxism_subtype_desc: "Marxism is a political philosophy and method of socioeconomic analysis. It uses a dialectical and materialist interpretation of historical development, better known as historical materialism, to analyse class relations, social conflict, and social transformation. Marxism originates with the works of 19th-century German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Marxism has developed over time into various branches and schools of thought, and as a result, there is no single, definitive "Marxist theory"."
 orthodox_engelism: "Orthodox Engelism"
 orthodox_engelism_desc: "Orthodox Engelism is a variant of Marxist theory rooted in the ideas of Friedrich Engels, who, alongside Karl Marx, co-authored foundational works on socialism and communism. It emphasizes the importance of class struggle, the material conditions of society, and the inevitability of a proletarian revolution leading to the establishment of a classless, stateless society. Orthodox Engelism adheres closely to the writings and principles outlined by Engels, advocating for a scientific approach to socialism, with a focus on the proletariat as the revolutionary class. This ideology rejects reformist approaches and supports the idea that only through the overthrow of the capitalist system can true social equality be achieved. In practice, it has influenced various socialist and communist movements that aim to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat as a transitional phase toward communism."
 luxemburgism: "Luxemburgism"
 luxemburgism_desc: "Luxemburgism is a Marxist theory based on the ideas of Rosa Luxemburg, advocating for revolutionary socialism through mass action, direct democracy, and the spontaneous involvement of the working class. It rejects the notion of a vanguard party leading the revolution, instead emphasizing the importance of workers' self-organization and grassroots movements. Luxemburgism criticizes both capitalist exploitation and the authoritarian tendencies within some socialist movements, arguing for a socialist society that is built through active participation and continuous struggle. It also stresses the need for international solidarity, believing that socialism cannot be fully realized in one country alone. While it shares common ground with other forms of Marxism, Luxemburgism's emphasis on democracy and anti-authoritarianism sets it apart from more centralized socialist approaches."
 council_communism: "Council Communism"
 council_communism_desc: "Council communism is a Marxist ideology that advocates for a decentralized, worker-controlled economy and governance system. It rejects both capitalist markets and traditional state-led socialism, instead promoting direct democracy through workers' councils that manage production and decision-making. This system emphasizes self-management, arguing that the proletariat should organize society collectively without the need for a ruling party or bureaucratic state. Council communists critique authoritarian tendencies in other socialist movements, believing that true communism can only be achieved through grassroots participation. While supporters see it as a democratic alternative to both capitalism and state socialism, critics argue that it lacks practical mechanisms for large-scale coordination and governance."
 left_communism: "Left Communism"
 left_communism_desc: "Left communism is a Marxist ideology that critiques both capitalist systems and the more moderate forms of socialism, particularly those that endorse state power or reformist approaches. It advocates for the immediate abolition of capitalism through a proletarian revolution, but rejects the idea of a transitional state or authoritarian leadership, which it believes can lead to new forms of oppression. Left communists emphasize the need for workers' councils and direct, democratic control of production, focusing on building a stateless, classless society. They critique the so-called "socialist" governments that arose in the 20th century for their authoritarianism, bureaucracy, and failure to fully realize communist ideals. Left communism is often considered more radical and anti-authoritarian than other strands of Marxism, such as Leninism or Stalinism."
 
 ## libertarian_socialism ##
 libertarian_socialism_subtype: "Libertarian socialism"
 sr_maximalism: "SR maximalism"
 reactionary_socialism: "Reactionary socialism"
 syndicalism: "Syndicalism"
 syndicalism_desc: "Syndicalism is a revolutionary socialist ideology advocating for the direct control of industry and government by workers' syndicates (trade unions). It emerged as a response to both capitalist exploitation and bureaucratic socialism, seeking to establish a decentralized economy based on worker self-management. Inspired by the writings of Georges Sorel and the successes of militant labor movements, syndicalists emphasize direct action, general strikes, and, if necessary, armed insurrection to overthrow the ruling class. Unlike Marxist-Leninists, they reject centralized party rule, instead favoring a bottom-up system where workers' councils coordinate production and governance. The First World War deepened class tensions, leading to the rise of syndicalist movements in France, Italy, Spain, and even parts of the United States. While some syndicalists align with anarchists in their opposition to state power, others envision a federation of syndicalist republics replacing traditional nation-states. Now, the ideology stands at a crossroads, with its adherents debating whether to pursue revolution independently or align with broader leftist movements to achieve their goals."
 anarcho_syndicalism: "Anarcho-Syndicalism"
 anarcho_syndicalism_desc: "Anarcho-Syndicalism, much like Anarcho-communism, places the collective need for classlessness and statelessness as an absolute priority, while, unlike communism, placing trade and worker's unions as the primary source of benefit to the worker and to the revolution overall. It is an ideology that rejects politics and argues that all actions should be set for the benefit of the many, rather than for the few."
 democratic_socialism: "Democratic Socialism"
 democratic_socialism_desc: "Democratic Socialism usually portrays a mix of socialist or even communist ideas combined with democratic values, sometimes even the ones seen in liberal western democracies. A democratic socialist country usually has a high focus on pacifism, worker rights and gender equality. However, so far, they are rarely seen across the world."
 anti_colonialism: "Anti-Colonialism"
 christian_socialism: "Christian Socialism" 
 platformism: "Platformism"
 platformism_desc: "Platformism is a form of anarchism that emphasizes organization, unity, and collective action among anarchists to achieve revolutionary goals. It advocates for a federated network of anarchist groups that work together based on a shared platform of common principles and tactics, while maintaining autonomy within their local contexts. The platform is seen as a set of ideological and strategic guidelines that help unify various anarchist factions without forcing ideological uniformity. Platformists believe that a more organized and cohesive anarchist movement is necessary to effectively challenge the state, capitalism, and other forms of oppression. While it stresses decentralization and direct democracy, critics argue that the platformist approach might lead to hierarchical structures or dilute the diversity of anarchist thought."
 anarcho_primitivism: "Anarcho-Primitivism"
 anarcho_primitivism_desc: "The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life expectancies of those of us who live in advanced countries and destabilized the entire world and unequally split wealth among its individuals while also totally obliterating the nature of our planet. We must return to nature, to Mother Earth. Otherwise, humanity will destroy itself. We must protect nature and humanity at all costs."

 social_stratocracy: "Social Stratocracy"
 social_stratocracy_desc: "Social Stratocracy, or Militant Social Democracy, is a branch of Social Democracy that focuses primarily on Statism, Patriotism, and which is strongly Centrist or Centre-left. It is a Militaristic ideology which supports forms of governance through the military, but also caters towards its people by providing a combination of social policies akin to other Social Democratic ideologies. A notable example is a capitalistic free market model pandered towards the Working class, or wide governmental support of National services such as Universal Healthcare and Education, with a strong belief that a powerful army and leading central figure are needed to uphold these ideals and principles."

 social_liberalism_desc: "Social liberalism is a political ideology that combines individual freedoms with a commitment to social justice and economic intervention to ensure equal opportunities. It supports civil liberties, democracy, and human rights while advocating for government policies that reduce social and economic inequalities. Social liberals believe in a mixed economy, where the state plays a role in regulating markets and providing welfare programs to protect the vulnerable. This ideology gained prominence in the 20th century, influencing policies on education, healthcare, and workers' rights. While it promotes personal freedom, critics argue that too much state intervention can lead to inefficiency and overregulation."

 conservatism_subtype: "Conservatism"
 paternalistic_conservatism: "Paternalistic conservatism"
 classical_conservatism_desc: "Classical Conservatism is a political ideology that emphasizes tradition, social stability, and the preservation of established institutions. It is rooted in the belief that society functions best when it maintains continuity with its past, respecting established customs, values, and authority structures. Classical conservatives argue that human nature is imperfect and that society requires stable institutions—such as the family, religion, and the state—to maintain order and prevent chaos. They typically advocate for limited government intervention, stressing the importance of personal responsibility and gradual change rather than radical reform. While it values liberty, classical conservatism often believes that freedom must be balanced with a respect for tradition and social order to avoid moral decay and societal fragmentation."

 mediacracy: "Mediacracy"
 mediacracy_desc: "A mediacracy is a political system in which media organizations and information control play a dominant role in shaping public opinion and government decisions. In such a system, politicians and policies are often influenced more by media narratives than by traditional democratic institutions. The concentration of media power can lead to manipulation, where public discourse is driven by sensationalism or corporate and political interests. While a free press is essential for democracy, excessive media influence can undermine objective policymaking and encourage populism. In modern societies, the rise of digital platforms and social networks has further amplified the impact of mediacracy on governance and public perception."
 regulationism: "Regulationism"
 plutocracy: "Plutocracy"
 plutocracy_desc: "A plutocracy is a political system in which power is concentrated in the hands of the wealthy, allowing economic elites to influence government decisions and policies. In such a system, wealth often translates into political control through campaign financing, lobbying, and control over media and institutions. This can lead to policies that favor the rich, such as lower taxes on high incomes and reduced regulations on businesses, while neglecting the needs of the lower and middle classes. Critics argue that plutocracy undermines democracy by prioritizing the interests of the few over the many, increasing social and economic inequality. While some defend wealth-driven leadership as a sign of meritocracy, opponents see it as a distortion of democratic principles."

 constitutional_monarchy: "Constitutional Monarchy"
 constitutional_monarchy_desc: "This is a system of governance in which there is a king and a royal family, but their powers are limited by a constitution and more often than not an institution like the parliament in which a Prime Minister holds a significant amount of power instead of the King retaining the absolute power in the country."
 national_democracy: "National Democracy"
 national_democracy_desc: "National Democracy is a political ideology that combines nationalist principles with democratic governance. It emphasizes the sovereignty and cultural identity of a nation while advocating for representative government and civil liberties. Supporters often prioritize national unity, controlled immigration, and economic policies that protect domestic industries. However, critics argue that it can lead to exclusionary or xenophobic policies if taken to extremes. Historically, various movements and parties have adopted National Democracy with differing interpretations, ranging from moderate conservatism to more radical nationalist positions."
 kemalism: "Kemalism"
 kemalism_desc: "Kemalism, as the name suggests, is based around the ideals of the Turkish Republic's founding figure, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Born as a rejection of the perceived backwardness of the late Ottoman period, Kemalists seek to create and preserve a modern Turkish nation-state based on six guiding ideals; republicanism, populism, nationalism, laicism, statism and reformism."

 despotism_subtype: "Despotism"
 despotism_subtype_desc: "In its classical form, despotism is a state in which a single individual (the despot) holds all the power and authority embodying the state, and everyone else is a subsidiary person. This form of despotism was common in the first forms of statehood and civilizations such as Ancient Egypt, and was reinvigorated under the rule of the Sun King Louis of France. Today, despotist nations are often either ruled by a monarch, a military strongman or an influential leading politician."

 corporatocracy: "Corporatocracy"
 corporatocracy_desc: "A corporatocracy is a political and economic system in which large corporations hold significant power over government decisions and public policy. In such a system, corporate interests often influence legislation, regulations, and even international relations, sometimes at the expense of democratic representation. This can lead to policies favoring big business, such as deregulation, tax breaks, and weakened labor protections, while limiting the influence of ordinary citizens. Critics argue that corporatocracy undermines democracy by prioritizing profit over social welfare and environmental sustainability. Proponents, however, claim that corporate involvement in governance can drive economic growth and innovation."
 rockfellerism: "Rockfellerism"
 rockfellerism_desc: "Rockefellerism is an ideology that combines the ideas of President John D. Rockefeller. It blends anarcho-corporate economic principles with conservative and religious social policies. This ideology is elitist in nature and is scarcely supported by the general population of the United States. To keep the people in check, the ideology also promotes the preservation of democratic institutions. Are these institutions truly democratic? Of course not! They are corrupt and fraudulent, supporting only the interests of large corporations."

 interim_government: "Provisional Government"
 absolute_monarchy: "Absolute Monarchy"
 absolute_monarchy_desc: "An absolute monarchy is a form of government in which a single ruler, usually a king or queen, holds complete and unrestricted power over the state. Unlike constitutional monarchies, there are no legal or institutional limits on the monarch’s authority, allowing them to make laws, control the military, and govern without parliamentary oversight. This system was common in pre-modern Europe, with rulers such as Louis XIV of France embodying the principle of "divine right," claiming their power came directly from God. While absolute monarchies can provide stability and decisive leadership, they often suppress political freedoms and rely on the ruler’s personal competence. Today, absolute monarchies are rare, mostly found in a few nations where traditional rule persists alongside modern governance."
 
 ## reactionism ##
 reactionism_subtype: "Reactionism"
 revolutionary_conservatism: "Revolutionary Conservatism"
 revolutionary_conservatism_desc: "Revolutionary conservatism is a political ideology that seeks to preserve traditional values, institutions, and cultural practices while advocating for radical or revolutionary changes to protect them from modernity or perceived decay. Unlike traditional conservatism, which typically favors gradual change and stability, revolutionary conservatism supports more drastic, sometimes violent, transformations in society to restore or defend what it views as essential cultural, social, and national foundations. It often emphasizes nationalism, social hierarchy, and the preservation of religious or moral values, positioning itself against liberalism, socialism, and globalism. Supporters argue that such revolutionary changes are necessary to counteract the erosion of traditions and the rise of destructive ideologies. Critics, however, warn that it can lead to authoritarianism or exacerbate divisions in society."

 theocratic_dictatorship: "Theocratic Dictatorship"
 theocratic_dictatorship_desc: "A theocratic dictatorship is a form of government in which political power is concentrated in the hands of a single leader or small group, and the state's policies are heavily influenced or directly governed by religious principles. In this system, religious leaders or institutions often hold significant authority, and the ruler is either considered divinely chosen or exercises power in accordance with religious laws. Theocratic dictatorships typically suppress political opposition, as dissent may be framed as a challenge to both the state and religious doctrine. Religious laws and teachings dictate not only governance but also personal behavior and societal norms, with little or no separation between religion and the state. Critics argue that this system can lead to authoritarian rule, limited personal freedoms, and the persecution of religious or ideological minorities."

Freemasonry emphasizes values such as brotherhood, charity, and integrity, with a focus on self-improvement through a system of moral teachings and symbolic rituals. Though not a religion, Freemasonry encourages belief in a higher power, often referred to as the "Great Architect of the Universe."
