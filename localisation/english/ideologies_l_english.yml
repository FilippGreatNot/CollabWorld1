 ### Subideologies ###
 ## bolshevism ##
 marxism_leninism: "Marxism-Leninism"
 marxism_leninism_desc: "Marxism-Leninism is a branch of Marxism developed by Vladimir Lenin and other figures.

 leninist_pragmatism_desc: "Lenin is undoubtedly a great man and leader. However, he is excessively idealistic. For the survival of the socialist state and the achievement of communism, a more realistic and pragmatic approach to politics, economics, and the party is needed. Of course, envy and revisionists accuse us of opportunism, but we know who the real opportunists are and who must pay for their counter-revolutionary actions." #Translated by ChatGPT, replace with manual translation if possible
 
 national_marxism: "Social Chauvinism"
 national_marxism_desc: "Social Chauvinism is a syncretic ideology that combines socialist elements with ultranationalist ideals, mainly extreme patriotism and exclusionism. Social Chauvinism's social structure is comprised of an in-group and an out-group, which are usually determined by culture, race, or religion. The in-group is treated much like any other member of a socialist state, whereas the out-group is seen as vermin or someone to convert."
 
 integral_socialism: "Integral Socialism"
 
 technocracy: "Technocracy"

 blanquism: "Blanquism"
 jacobinism: "Jacobinism"

 communist_bismarckism: "Social Bismarckism"
 communist_bismarckism_desc: "Our people can truly be called the engine of history. Unfortunately, they fell victim to betrayal. Betrayal by the bourgeoisie and the ambitions of the generals in the Weltkrieg, the negligence of officers, and the sabotage by ordinary soldiers. However, history moves forward, towards liberation. From now on, the people will not be oppressed; the hand of the proletariat and traditions, in alliance with the faithful hand of the leader, lead us into a new era, an era of prosperity for the German nation and the common man."

Other ethnicities or minorities are often opressed and have their rights stripped away. Bolshevik Nationalism is highly Anti-Semitic and often blames Judaism for being Capitalist in its nature. Overall, the ideology is the perfect example of what many political theorists view as the Horseshoe Theory."
